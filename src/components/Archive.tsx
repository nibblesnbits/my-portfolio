              Not shouted loud, nor made to last,

              Small things left soft, but not forgot—

              In shadows where the quiet grows,

              this is the place where feeling flows.

              But then a man, with heart in hand,

              came seeking peace, not promised land.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text text-center">
              A builder once, with steady hands,
              <br />
              who’d shaped a city from the sands.
              <br />
              But not even cities carved from will
              <br />
              could teach a grieving heart to still.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text text-center">
              And so he fell—not through the sky—
              <br />
              but inward, with a silent cry.
              <br />
              Through thought, through loss, through threads unseen,
              <br />
              he stepped into a world between.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text text-center">
              No door. No path. No whispered name.
              <br />
              But something heard him all the same.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text text-center">
              He did not mean to find this place.
              <br />
              He only sought to still his pace.
              <br />
              To stop the world—if just a breath—
              <br />
              and name the ache that echoed death.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text text-center">
              And in the days of storm and wind,
              <br />
              he shaped a world to hold within.

              The Elsebeneath would now abide

              all the things we kept inside.

            <p className="story-text text-center">
              A girl let go a folded note.
              <br />A mother tied a ribbon’s throat.
              <br />A soldier left a porcelain cup—
              <br />
              and the Elsebeneath began to wake up.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text text-center">
              They didn’t enter.

              Not like him.
              <br />
              But unsaid things began to swim.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text text-center">
              The cup remembered what was sworn.
              <br />
              The ribbon wept and curled, forlorn.
              <br />
              The paper paused mid-fall—then stayed.
              <br />
              The wind, at last, began to braid.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text text-center">
              So understand: this place was made
              <br />
              not all at once, and not by trade.
              <br />
              But by the weight of things unspoken—
              <br />
              the cracks that form when hearts are broken.
            </p>
            <p className="story-text text-center">
              The Elsebeneath is not a lie.
              <br />
              It’s just a place where truths still try.

            Chapter 1: <em>Things Lost</em>
          </h1>
          <p className="story-text">
            A short, slender black cat stepped over a crooked windowsill and
            onto the street, tail flicking as she landed. Her fur shimmered with
            dust motes that hadn’t figured out they weren’t part of the night.
            Around her neck, a charm swung gently from a fraying thread: a tiny
            brass telescope, rusted at the hinge.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She’d walked these streets before they had names. In that age, she
            had a purpose. Or maybe just a title. She couldn’t remember which.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Now, she moved like someone who had lived everywhere and nowhere,
            and neither had asked her to stay.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">She moved anyway.</p>
          <p className="story-text">The wind had stopped singing.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            It hadn’t left, exactly. It still moved—still stirred ribbons
            hanging from windows, still curled beneath doorways in sighs that
            hadn’t quite decided to speak.
            <br />
            But it no longer carried songs, or laughter, or the soft spill of
            memories.
            <br />
            Just hush.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            But that was always the way of the Elsebeneath. It was never a place
            that made up its mind.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She padded past a chimepost and paused. One of the threads had
            snapped. A shard of porcelain—teacup, maybe—still swayed slightly,
            making a sound that wasn’t quite a note.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She sat. Listened.
            <br />
            It reminded her of something.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">She didn’t remember what.</p>
          <p className="story-text">That was fine.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            If she’d forgotten, it must not have been hers to carry.
            <br />
            And if it had been beautiful, someone else would remember it.
            <br />
            That was how beauty worked, wasn’t it?
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The wind curled past her whiskers, carrying a thread of old
            warmth—rosemary bread, thunder before it rains, a blanket being
            tucked too tightly.
            <br />
            She purred, but only slightly.
            <br />
            The moment passed. The wind moved on.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">So did she.</p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            She walked for a while, toward nothing in particular.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The village had never been orderly, but today it felt... unfinished.
            Like the world had paused mid-fold and forgotten what corner to
            tuck.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            People moved quietly through the streets, dressed in grays so gray
            and blacks so deep they felt borrowed from another world.
            <br />
            Faces were soft, smoothed out. Worn down like river stones, passed
            over by memory too many times.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel watched from beneath a weather-warped bench. Her whiskers
            twitched. She could feel it in her fur.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Something was missing. Something young? Or maybe she forgot.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A small crowd had gathered by the stone garden. No chimes rang. Not
            even the broken ones.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A hush carried over the crowd like mist.
            <br />A man stood near the back. Gray coat. Tall frame. Hands folded
            in front of him like they were trying to hold something in.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel saw the grief before she recognized the face.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable.</p>
          <p className="story-text">No words. No tears.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She’d met him before grief reshaped his spine. Back when his voice
            still reached above a whisper.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He stood motionless, face intent on stones piled carefully in the
            center of the garden.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel crept closer, quiet as dusk.
            <br />
            She didn’t need to see the box.
            <br />
            Didn’t need to count how many people turned away too quickly.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">She padded up near Gable, and sat.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A young boy stepped to the front, cradling a small stone with a name
            carved into its surface and a ribbon wrapped tightly around it. With
            silent tears, he sat it carefully in a marked spot in the garden,
            and stepped back into the crowd.
            <br />
            Whatever he thought, it clung to him instead of reaching his mouth.
            <br />
            Or maybe he’d already started to forget.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel tilted her head, watching the boy for a moment. She knew his
            face.
            <br />
            Or rather, the <em>shape</em> of it.
            <br />
            Something tugged at her memory—soft, then sharp.
            <br />
            The longer she looked, the more it felt like something was missing.
            Some part of her she had forgotten.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Loss isn’t often what we wish it was.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable looked down and put a single finger to his lips.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel narrowed her eyes. Blinked once. Looked away.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Sometimes, the youngest ones don&#39;t know what they are
            carrying.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Another finger. Same silence.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel swished her tail.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Rude.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable rolled his eyes, the corner of his mouth twitching toward
            something that wasn’t a smile.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“We’re mourning, Vel.”</p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            By the time the mourners began to leave, the sky had shifted into
            stone-like hues.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable stayed.
            <br />
            Vel sat beside him, tail curled tight.
            <br />
            She didn’t speak again. Not yet.
            <br />
            Some silences preferred to be left alone. Even she knew that.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The last of the wind passed them by—something that used to be a
            lullaby.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small index
            card.
            <br />
            He didn’t read it. Just held it the same way he’d held his silence
            earlier.
            <br />
            Just held it, like it had already said everything it needed to.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel watched him for a long moment.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Then, softly:</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Was it the kind you meant to say?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable closed his hand around the card.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“I don’t know yet.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The wind, it seemed, had forgotten how to carry certain things.

          <p className="story-text">
            He moved like someone with nowhere to go—just a quiet trust that the
            right place would show up anyway.

          <p className="story-text">
            Vel followed a few paces behind, tail low, stepping over cracks
            she’d never noticed before. The Elsebeneath was always shifting, but
            today the cobblestones didn&#39;t lean in any direction in
            particular.

          <p className="story-text">
            They passed the teacup tree, though only a few cups still clung to
            the branches. The others had fallen or faded. No one seemed to
            notice.

          <p className="story-text">
            The light above the Listening Post flickered but didn’t call out.
            <br />
            The noteboard was empty.
            <br />
            Not even the chimes made a sound.

          <p className="story-text">
            By the time they reached the Archive, the sky had started to forget

            Gable climbed the three shallow steps, the ones that always creaked
            in slightly different tones depending on the weather.
            <br />
            Today, they didn’t say much.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He reached the door, paused, then looked back at her.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Coming in?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel didn’t answer.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            For a moment, the wind caught in her fur.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She remembered the first time she stepped through that door—
            <br />
            how the books had all twisted their spines toward her at once.
            <br />
            Like they recognized someone she used to be.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">She hadn’t gone back in since.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable sighed, but not at her. “Suit yourself.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He nodded once and put a hand on the door.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The door didn’t resist.
            <br />
            But it didn’t quite <em>welcome</em> him either.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Its hinges moved in silence—not the comfortable kind, but the kind
            that sounded like something remembering how to move.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The light was the same as always—dusk-colored and indirect, leaving
            dust motes and memories hanging in the air.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He stood for a moment in the doorway.
            <br />
            The warmth in this place was subtle, but it never left.
            <br />
            He used to think it came from the floorboards, or the lamps.
            <br />
            Now he suspected it came from the books.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He stepped inside, boots whispering against worn wooden floors. A
            stack of blank index cards sat on a side table near the
            door—refreshed, somehow, though he hadn’t restocked them. The box
            beside them was labeled:

          <p className="story-text">
            Same as always.

          <p className="story-text">To the left: the stacks.</p>

          <p className="story-text">
            The bookshelves were tall, uneven. Some leaned just slightly; time
            did that when enough thoughts are carried.
            <br />
            Others had steps built into them, not ladders—little carved
            platforms where you might pause halfway to a thought.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He passed a familiar spine:{" "}

          <p className="story-text">He ran a finger along the edge.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The smell of smoke and salt rose up, sharp enough to sting. Gable
            pulled his hand back, heart quickening. The Archive didn’t forget
            smells—it chose them.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The book shivered faintly.
            <br />
            Didn’t open.
            <br />
            Didn’t need to.

          <p className="story-text">
            But it didn’t feel quite like it used to.

          <p className="story-text">
            Some ended midsentence.

            Some ended mid-thought.
            <br />
            One entire shelf was filled with books whose final page had been too
            much to finish.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He passed a volume bound in cracked red leather, its title stamped
            faintly in gold:

          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">He didn’t open that one either.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Some stories didn’t need reading.
            <br />
            Some just needed a place to wait.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">He rounded the shelf and stopped.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The light bent strangely here—like it didn’t know what to land on.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A small table had appeared where no table should’ve been.
            <br />
            Not unusual, in theory. The Archive did that sometimes. The table’s
            surface bore a faint scratch—a jagged line, like a word
            half-written. Gable’s fingers froze above it. He’d seen that mark
            before, in a memory the Archive wasn’t supposed to keep.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He crossed to the next shelf and paused. A stack of three books lay
            on a table that hadn’t been there yesterday. No candle, no chair.
            Just the books. Their titles were handwritten, as always:
          </p>
          <ul className="bullet-list">

          <p className="story-text">
            Some of the books had not been placed there, but they had arrived
            all the same

          <p className="story-text">
            He touched the top one, and felt something like warmth move through
            his fingertips.

          <p className="story-text">
            “You’re here again,” he murmured to the shelf.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            It didn’t answer, but the chime above it stirred.
            <br />
            Low and soft, like a memory waking.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He didn’t look up.
            <br />

          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The chimes always knew when someone had come home.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            The Archive settled behind him like any winter home, all creaks,
            groans and cupboard sighs.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He passed the long table where visitors sometimes paused to write—
            <br />
            empty tonight, save for a single card turned facedown.
            <br />
            He didn’t flip it over.
            <br />
            Some things didn’t need rereading.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            At the end of the hall, the door to his room waited ajar.
            <br />
            He nudged it open, letting the familiar dusk-light spill in.
            <br />
            Muted walls.
            <br />A small bed with creaking joints.
            <br />
            One lamp that only ever flickered when he was lying.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He sat.
            <br />
            Slowly.
            <br />
            Like someone who knew what he was about to feel.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The drawer beside the bed stuck a little—
            <br />
            always had.
            <br />
            He didn’t force it.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Just waited.</p>
          <p className="story-text">And after a breath or two, it relented.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Inside:
            <br />A bundle of index cards.
            <br />
            Wrapped in a threadbare strip of linen.
            <br />
            Edges curled.
            <br />
            One corner singed.
            <br />
            Another—
            <br />
            still damp,
            <br />
            even now.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He didn’t remember which memory had burned.
            <br />
            Or which one had cried.

          <p className="story-text">

            Outside, the wind threaded through the shutters, quieter than
            breath.

          <p className="story-text">
            Somewhere beyond the walls, Vel curled against the base of a
            fountain, tail wrapped tight.
            <br />
            She didn’t sleep—not really—but she closed her eyes and listened.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            To the gurgles.
            <br />
            To the quiet.
            <br />
            To the memory of a place that still knew her name,
            <br />
            even if she couldn’t carry it.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A chime above the fountain rang once, sharp and wrong, like a voice
            out of tune. Vel’s ears twitched. She didn’t move—not yet—but her
            claws flexed against the stone.

          <p className="story-text">Sam walked alone.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He had a scarf made of stitched together neckties wrapped around his
            neck, flowing back in a gentle breeze that told him exactly where
            the best bread in town was today.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He hummed as he walked. Something tuneless but content. A little
            melody that had followed him from a dream and hadn’t quite let go.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Chimes whispered above him, strung from corners and doorways like
            polite ghosts. Some rang clear and bright, others sighed low and
            slow—half-memories of lullabies. A few didn’t sound at all, but
            shimmered like they wanted to.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam tilted his head as he passed one that let out a quick, high

            There were books everywhere. Not lined up neatly, but leaning—like
            they’d grown tired of standing at attention and preferred soft
            angles and casual conversations.

            He walked toward the fallen book, crouched, and read the inside

          <p className="story-text">A slow grin spread across his face.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“…Okay. That’s... oddly specific.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A voice answered from somewhere between the shelves:
          </p>
          <blockquote className="story-callout">
            <p className="story-text">“It always is.”</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">Sam turned.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A man stood in the shadow of a tall shelf, arms crossed, eyebrows
            raised.
            <br />
            He had the kind of presence that didn’t rush to introduce
            itself—just waited for you to get the hint.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            His coat looked slept in. His eyes didn’t.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “You the librarian?” Sam asked, brushing dust from the book’s spine.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable considered that.
            <br />
            “No one really ‘librarians’ the Archive. I mostly apologize to it.
            And take notes.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He stepped forward, and the floor gave a polite creak beneath his
            boots.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            &quot;Name&#39;s Gable. Don&#39;t mind the books. They&#39;re
            usually well behaved.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The book lifted itself slightly off the ground as he neared, then
            thudded back down with a sound suspiciously like <em>hmph.</em>
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam’s eyes widened. “Did it just—?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “They get dramatic,” Gable muttered, crouching to gently nudge the
            book upright. “Ignore the performance. It’s mostly for the new
            ones.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam looked around slowly.
            <br />
            “So… what <em>is</em> this place?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable didn’t answer right away.
            <br />
            Instead, he stepped past Sam and gestured toward a nearby wall,
            where a simple wooden box sat on a side table. Inside: index cards.
            Fresh, blank. Waiting.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">The label read:</p>
          <blockquote className="story-callout">
            <p className="story-text">
              <strong>For What You Almost Said</strong>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable rested his hand on the edge of the box, fingers brushing
            lightly over the rim like it was an old friend.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “This is where the words go,” he said. “The ones people don’t say
            out loud. The ones they almost said. Or wanted to. Or couldn’t. The
            Archive keeps them. Just in case.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam looked back at the rows of books—some humming faintly, some
            gently pulsing like they held breath.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“…Ok, that&#39;s kinda cool.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “It’s also wildly inconvenient,” Gable said. “They’re organized by
            resonance, not topic. And the autobiographies file themselves.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam blinked.
            <br />
            “Wait. So you don’t file anything?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I tried, once,” Gable said, eyes narrowed. “The books refiled{" "}
            <em>me.</em>”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He gestured to a narrow hallway deeper in, where a placard hung
            crookedly from the wall.
          </p>
          <blockquote className="story-callout">
            <p className="story-text">
              <em>“Quiet, Please. Some Feelings Are Sleeping.”</em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">Gable sighed.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Come on. I’ll show you how it works before something shelves{" "}
            <em>you.</em>”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable led him down a corridor of leaning shelves and tilted light.
            <br />
            No two lamps matched.
            <br />
            Some flickered.
            <br />
            One buzzed faintly in Morse code, but Sam didn’t know the alphabet
            well enough to tell what it was feeling.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            They turned a corner, and Gable stopped in front of a modest table
            with two chairs. One had a cushion flattened by use; the other
            looked like it had only recently decided to exist.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A blank card sat in the center of the table.
            <br />
            Waiting.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable didn’t sit. He just gestured.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Most people think this place is about memory,” he said.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“It’s not.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He picked up the card, holding it loosely.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “It’s about <em>almost.</em>”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam tilted his head and smiled.
            <br />
            “That tracks.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable picked up the card, held it between thumb and forefinger.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “The Archive doesn’t store facts. It stores{" "}
            <em>emotional potential.</em> What someone nearly said. Almost
            admitted. Thought about shouting and whispered instead.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">He held the card out. Sam took it.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            It felt… normal. A little thicker than usual. Edges soft from being
            held once or twice too often.
            <br />
            But nothing written. Not yet.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “If you’re holding back something important,” Gable said quietly,
            “it writes itself.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam looked at it.
            <br />
            Then at him.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“That’s not creepy at all.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “It’s better than honesty,” Gable said with a shrug. “Honesty is
            what you choose to share. This place remembers what you{" "}
            <em>meant.</em>”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam wandered again—this time slower.
            <br />
            The Archive didn’t look bigger, but it <em>felt</em> deeper now.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">He passed a shelf labeled:</p>
          <blockquote className="story-callout">
            <p className="story-text">
              <em>“Things I Meant to Say at the Wedding”</em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">
            Every book had a ribbon bookmark sticking out, many of them
            tear-stained.
            <br />
            One fluttered faintly as he passed, like it had been waiting for him
            to show up since page fourteen.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Farther on: a thinner volume lay open on a pedestal.

          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">
            He touched the edge.
            <br />A quiet heat moved through his palm—recognition without shame.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He passed a weathered wall with a fading poster half-curling off at
            the edges.
            <br />
            Someone had tried to smooth it out, but only half-successfully. The
            image was a snail with racing stripes painted, badly, down it&#39;s
            shell.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">The caption read:</p>
          <blockquote className="story-callout">
            <p className="story-text">“SHELL ON, HEAD HIGH!”</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">Sam gave the snail a nod.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Thanks, Zoomie”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam grinned. “You guys have the weirdest motivational posters.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable didn’t look up from where he was sorting cards by
            resonance—most of them fluttering indignantly under his fingers.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Not ours. They show up on their own. Probably because someone once
            meant to say that and never did.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam kept moving.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A card stuck out of a stack, just slightly.
            <br />
            He tugged it free.
          </p>
          <blockquote className="story-callout">
            <p className="story-text">
              <em>“I don’t want to be alone.”</em>

          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">His breath caught.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            No fancy script.
            <br />
            No ink bleed.
            <br />
            Just a sentence—raw, plain.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            And then—
            <br />
            <strong>Fen.</strong>
            <br />
            Sitting alone against a frost-ribbed wall, shoulders tight, jaw set
            against the tremble he wouldn’t let show.
            <br />
            The Mountain of Mastery.
            <br />
            The moment Sam left.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            It came all at once.
            <br />
            Not like a memory.
            <br />
            Like a truth arriving late.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Fen,” Sam whispered.</p>
          <p className="story-text">And the image vanished.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He clutched the card a little too tightly, like it might keep the
            flicker in place.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Behind him, Gable’s voice was softer than before.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “That’s the kind the Archive keeps best.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam turned slowly.
            <br />
            Gable was looking at him—really <em>looking</em>—and there was
            something familiar in the pain behind his eyes.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Recognition.
            <br />A silhouette.
            <br />
            Of someone he&#39;d just mourned.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam tucked the card back between two others, a little awkwardly—as
            if afraid the shelves might judge his filing method.
            <br />
            They did.
            <br />A book to his left let out a faint <em>scoff,</em> fluttered
            its pages in offense, then shuffled two inches away like it didn’t
            want to be associated with him.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">He stepped back with his hands up.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Okay! Fine! I didn’t take the Dewey Decimal class, alright?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The shelves grumbled.
            <br />A stack of note cards nearby rustled, like someone clearing
            their throat through stationary.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable smirked.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“They’re being polite. For you.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Polite?” Sam looked around. “A book just scoffed at me.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Yeah. Last week someone tried to categorize a feeling as a{" "}
            <em>genre.</em> Three books tackled him.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam opened his mouth.
            <br />
            Closed it.
            <br />
            Nodded slowly.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Okay. That’s fair.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">He kept walking.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A card peeked out of a shelf as he passed.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Another flared in color—briefly, like a blush—then stilled.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            One book unlatched itself, leaned out halfway, and waited.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Spine open.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam paused.
            <br />
            The title read:
          </p>
          <blockquote className="story-callout">
            <p className="story-text">
              <em>“What I Wish He Understood”</em>

          <p className="story-text">He swallowed.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Didn’t open it.
            <br />
            Didn’t need to.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He turned to say something—maybe to ask Gable if this happened
            often—
            <br />
            but the older man was standing still behind him, watching with
            something that wasn’t quite suspicion.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">More like... awe.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“That notebook,” Gable said. “Yours?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam glanced down.
            <br />
            Tucked into his bag, as always, was the small clothbound notebook
            his mother had given him for his tenth birthday.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Yeah,” he said. “My mom gave it to me. It’s kind of... I don&#39;t
            know. Grounding.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable stepped forward, brow furrowed.
            <br />
            “Can I?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam hesitated. Then handed it over.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable flipped through the pages. His eyes stopped on one, then
            narrowed.
            <br />
            He read aloud:
          </p>
          <blockquote className="story-callout">

          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">
            He looked up.
            <br />
            “Did you write this?”

          <p className="story-text">
            Sam shook his head. “No. That’s Brynn’s handwriting. She’s a baker
            in the Village. But... she never had this notebook.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">He paused.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “It just... appeared one day. With things people <em>would’ve</em>{" "}
            said. Or <em>should’ve?</em> Not sure.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable handed it back, slower now.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “The Archive doesn’t do messages,” he said quietly. “It holds
            thoughts. Feelings. It remembers <em>us</em>—but only when we mean
            it.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He looked down at the notebook.
            <br />
            “The question is… who meant <em>you.</em>”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam held it against his chest. It felt warm again. Steady. Like it
            knew its job.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “She did,” he said softly. “I think of her every time I touch it.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable nodded.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Welcome to the Archive.”</p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            They made their way back toward the main desk—though “desk” was
            generous. It looked more like a repurposed piano lid with drawers
            where keys should’ve been.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He didn’t explain that. He just handed Sam a new card.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Keep it,” Gable said. “It’ll write itself. When it&#39;s ready.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam turned it over in his hands.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“You just hand these out to anyone?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable shrugged.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Only if they’re already carrying something.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam didn’t argue.
            <br />
            Didn’t say thank you.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Instead, he unwrapped the scarf from around his neck, and handed it
            up to Gable.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “You can keep this,” he said. “He wouldn’t mind.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable hesitated.
            <br />
            Took it gently, like it might say something if crumpled the wrong
            way.
            <br />
            He didn’t know why it felt important—only that some gifts arrived
            before you knew how to need them.
            <br />
            It felt like trust, folded gently.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Inside one of the seams was a small, white piece of cloth with a
            message in long, flowy script.

          <blockquote className="story-callout">
            <p className="story-text">For Graham. – Granny</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">“Who was he?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam smiled.</p>
          <blockquote className="story-callout">
            <p className="story-text">
              “Someone I haven’t stopped listening to.”

          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable wrapped the scarf once around his wrist, eyed it like a
            wristwatch, then motioned Sam back towards the door.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“You’ll fit in just fine, here, kid.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">

          <p className="story-text">
            The village had begun to settle.
            <br />
            Not quiet, exactly—Elsebeneath was never truly silent—but still.
            <br />
            Like someone holding their breath between memories.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable walked slowly.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The scarf was now tied loosely around his wrist, trailing like a
            forgotten sentence.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He passed shuttered windows, doorways with listening threads,
            ribbons that didn’t rustle anymore.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            And there—on a crooked windowsill, half-tucked in shadow—Vel blinked
            at him.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“You gave him a card,” she said.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Her voice was lazy, half-purr.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“He gave me a scarf,” Gable replied.</p>
          <p className="story-text">She tilted her head, whiskers twitching.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Fair trade?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">He paused.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“We’ll see.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel flicked her tail once, then tucked it around her paws like a
            question mark.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            And, after a long silence—
            <br />
            “You didn’t know the kid.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable looked out past her—toward the part of the sky that had
            forgotten its color again.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “No,” he said. “Not well. But he used to come in. Told stories.
            About stars, mostly. One time he swore the moon had feelings.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">He smiled faintly.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Made the books laugh.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel didn’t answer right away.
            <br />
            She watched a breeze pass by and didn’t chase it.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Then, softly:</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Some people are harder to forget, even if you don’t remember why.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable nodded once.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            And didn’t say anything more.
            <br />
            But the wind, somewhere behind them, tried to.

          <h1 className="chapter-title">

          <p className="story-text">The pool didn’t ripple.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            It never really did—not in the usual way.{" "}

          <p className="story-text">
            Vel sat at the edge, tail curled loosely, eyes half-lidded. The
            surface mirrored just enough of the sky to make you wonder if the
            clouds were waiting for permission to drift.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable joined her without ceremony. No greeting. Just the faint creak
            of old boots and the kind of sigh people only let out when they
            forget they’re being heard.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A thread of breeze passed between them—dry, tired, and uninterested
            in mischief.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Eventually, Vel spoke.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“You used to talk more.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable let the words settle before answering.
            <br />A small shrug. A tilt of the head like maybe the memory didn’t
            quite fit the same way anymore.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“I used to have more to say.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel felt something in her chest she couldn&#39;t place.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“I used to have more to give. I think.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable leaned forward slightly, elbows on knees, eyes fixed on the
            unmoving water like it owed him a reflection he hadn’t earned yet.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I walked past the Hall of Misremembered Names yesterday. It smelled
            like chalk. It used to smell like rain.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel&#39;s eyes met his, but she didn&#39;t speak.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“And... there was a boy,” he said.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Curious kid. Kind. Reminds me of...”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He let out a small sound—half breath, half laugh.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel blinked slowly. Her tail twitched once against the stone.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I didn’t remember his name, Vel,&quot; Gable said softly.
            <br />
            &quot;I didn&#39;t—”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel didn’t answer, but her tail twitched.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “It’s too still here,” she muttered, standing up with a stretch.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Come on. Walk with me.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable glanced at her, uncertain. Still folded inward.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“You trying to fix me?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “No,” she said. “But evening winds are best for remembering.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He didn’t ask what she meant.
            <br />
            Didn’t argue either.
            <br />
            He stood.
            <br />
            And they walked.
            <br />
            Like two ghosts humoring gravity.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">The village was between selves again.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Some streets leaned east, some pretended they never had. Shadows
            curved in directions that didn’t match the light. A ribbon caught on
            a lantern post trembled as they passed.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable spoke quietly as they walked.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I keep thinking if I write it down now, it won’t mean the same
            thing.
            <br />
            It won’t be remembering. Just pretending I always knew.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel said nothing. Her ears twitched, but not at him.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A door they&#39;d just passed creaked open on its own, spilling the
            scent of eucalyptus and old ink into the street. She didn’t glance
            at it. She already knew it wasn’t for them.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Some names get erased twice,” she said softly. “Once from the
            mouth. Once from the wind.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable stopped and looked down at his boots like they’d failed him
            somehow.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“I don’t want to forget anyone else.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel stopped beside him.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Just for a moment.
            <br />
            And they continued.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            They reached a fork where the cobblestones stopped pretending to
            agree. One path curved past the Listening Post, threadbare and
            humming. The other sloped down into something softer—less a street,
            more a suggestion.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable paused.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I think I’ll check the board,” he said, gesturing left. “Haven’t
            been by in a few days.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel nodded.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“I’ll loop around.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            They didn’t say goodbye.
            <br />
            Elsebeneath goodbyes weren’t about leaving.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable gave a half-wave, already distracted. The wind tugged at his
            coat as he turned.
            <br />
            Vel stood still until he disappeared around the curve.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">The air changed.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Not colder. Not warmer. Just… more aware of her.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel exhaled. Her tail twitched once, then stilled.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A ribbon above her rustled. The threads it was tied to were taut.
            They remembered something.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">So did she.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Only halfway.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She took a single step forward, and the stones beneath her paw rang
            slightly off-key.
            <br />
            Another step. The sound sharpened.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Somewhere ahead, just past the bend of the not-quite-street, the
            Archive waited.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She didn’t look.
            <br />
            Didn’t have to.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">She paused in the middle of the street.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Even her breath didn’t sound like it belonged to her anymore.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The Archive wasn’t in view yet, not really. But the air had started
            to taste like old parchment and words never said. She could feel its
            memory of her brushing the edges of thought—not gently.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Another step.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A chime shivered, faint and discordant. A door behind her unlocked
            itself and didn’t open. The Elsebeneath didn’t speak in
            sentences—but it was muttering now, under its breath.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel swallowed. Her paws ached, though she hadn’t walked far. Her fur
            was too warm.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            <em>“No…”</em>
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She felt it:
            <br />
            Sand. A hallway lined in gold and grief. Hands pressed into mud.
            <br />A chant she didn’t remember learning, sung in a voice that
            wasn’t hers—
            <br />
            but carried her name anyway.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            <em>“I’m not ready,”</em> she said aloud. To the street. To the
            wind.
            <br />
            To herself.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            No one answered.
            <br />
            That felt like an answer.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A whisper from the Archive curled under the doorways around her.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “The Elsebeneath echoes what it’s given,” she muttered.
            <br />
            “And I&#39;ve already given you everything. All at once.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">A pause.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She looked up.
            <br />
            Gable was nowhere in sight.

          <p className="story-text">That was good.</p>
          <p className="story-text">This wasn’t his story.</p>

          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A breeze pushed against her—not strong. Deliberate.

            handle small enough for her paws. Just the faintest shimmer where
            the outline of passage had once been drawn and then forgotten.

          <p className="story-text">
            Stacks bent toward her, as if shaped by years of listening. Books
            shifted in slow arcs, twisting at the spine to catch a glimpse of
            her as she passed. Some unraveled slightly at their corners, threads
            curling into question marks. A shelf creaked nearby—impatient.

          <p className="story-text">Vel stepped inside.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Her paws touched the floor in silence, but the stone answered
            anyway—vibrating with a low, mechanical hum. It didn’t greet her.

          <p className="story-text">She kept walking.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Thoughts gathered in strands. Words curled mid-breath, half-formed,
            half-forgotten. Overhead, a page turned with a sound like distant
            thunder.
          </p>

          <p className="story-text">
            Books tipped slightly as she passed. A few opened just enough to
            breathe out suggestion. One slipped free from its shelf entirely,
            dangling by its spine like it was hoping she’d reach out and finish
            what it started. A strip of parchment floated down and brushed her
            cheek, whispering a name she hadn’t heard in ages.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Her breath caught.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Stop,” she whispered.</p>

            Then—

            Her legs folded without ceremony.
            <br />
            Her lungs forgot their rhythm.
            <br />
            And then she was on the floor, warm breath rising beneath her, like
            the Archive had just let go of something it had held too long.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Her eyes closed.</p>

          <p className="story-text">
            Closer.

            gleamed with sweat and copper dust. Around her ankles, loose bells
            whispered with each step—barely audible, as if even sound was
            uncertain it should follow her.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            They had painted her eyes with coal and crushed malachite. The

            Then he turned—slowly—and began walking toward the front of the
            Archive.

          <p className="story-text">
            Vel didn’t follow.

          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            He reached the table by the entrance—an old slab of warped wood,
            covered in dust and half-curled index cards. Most of them were
            blank.
            <br />
            One or two twitched faintly as he neared.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">He picked one up.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Held it.
            <br />
            Didn’t flip it over.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            It was heavier than it should’ve been. He sighed.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            &quot;Your sighs always did sound older than you are.&quot;
            Vel&#39;s voice crept around the corner as slowly as she did.

          <p className="story-text">
            &quot;You&#39;re not a drawer, Gable.&quot;

          <p className="story-text">
            Gable&#39;s face twisted. &quot;What?&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            &quot;I can&#39;t just pull and make you open up. You have to let me
            in.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable&#39;s face dropped. He turned and leaned on the doorframe,
            door still open wide.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            &quot;I was fifteen, Vel.&quot; His head fell back.

            “But he left. And the night before he did, he came into my room,

            He let the words come now. One hand still on the doorframe, the

            The door was open again.
            <br />
            But this time, it was on purpose.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam stepped through with both hands full—a paper box tilted
            carefully against his chest, still warm, still dusted with sugar. A
            chime just above the threshold gave a lazy jingle, like it had been
            napping and didn’t mind being woken.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Inside, the Archive was calm.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He walked to the long table near the front, cleared a corner with
            the sweep of a sleeve, and set the box down with exaggerated
            ceremony.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable emerged from the back, coat draped over one shoulder, eyes
            rimmed with tired.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He stopped a few feet from the table and raised an eyebrow.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“What do we have here?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam opened the box, revealing three flaky pastries, slightly smashed
            from the journey.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Trade secret,” he said. “One riddle, one story, and a promise to
            return the basket. That gets you three.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable gave a slow nod. “Brynn’s still got the touch.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Don’t let her hear you say that. She made me swear I’d tell no one
            about the part where she smiled.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">They sat.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            No ritual. No plates. Just a mutual understanding of what pastries
            are <em>for.</em>
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable took a bite, chewed, and frowned slightly.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Too much nutmeg.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam looked offended. “That’s the point.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">“It’s a distraction.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">“It’s a personality.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable said nothing, but his second bite was bigger.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            They ate in easy silence for a few minutes. Crumbs collected like
            confessions along the table’s edge. The Archive didn’t seem to mind.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam glanced around between bites.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“So... Which one is yours?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable blinked. “What?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Where your stuff ends up. What does the Archive file you under?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable leaned back in his chair and exhaled through his nose.
            “I&#39;d tell you, but the books might hear.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Sounds mysterious.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Sounds accurate.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam grinned and leaned in.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I bet it’s something like ‘Things Left in Coat Pockets.’ Or ‘Words
            With Splinters.’”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable raised an eyebrow. “Splinters?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Yeah, like… words that stuck. The kind you don’t notice until
            later, when you touch something else and it hurts.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable looked at him for a long moment, then—quietly—smiled.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam brightened. “Ha! I’m right, aren’t I?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“You’re something.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            They returned to their pastries. Gable pulled a card from his
            pocket, set it on the table.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable didn’t say anything. Just watched him.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam looked up. “Is this mine?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Keep it safe,” Gable said with a wink.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The card sat between them like a fourth pastry—less sweet, maybe,
            but more filling. Sam picked up the card and gave it a look.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">&quot;It&#39;s blank.&quot;</p>
          <p className="story-text">&quot;For now.&quot;</p>
          <p className="story-text">They didn’t talk much after that.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable started sorting a pile of cards near the table’s edge. Sam
            began building a very deliberate tower out of sugar flakes and
            folded napkins.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam brushed the last of the crumbs off his shirt, and stood.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            &quot;Welp. Off to another adventure,&quot; he said as the strode to
            the door.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">A book tilted slightly as he passed.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Its spine read:</p>

          <p className="story-text">Sam paused.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Smiled.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            As the door clicked softly behind Sam, the room stilled again.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">For half a breath.</p>

            Gable turned back to his stack of cards. “You going to say something

            Vel swallowed. Licked a crumb from her whiskers.

            Then Vel tilted her head slightly and asked, “He’s going to ask

          <p className="story-text">Then asked, perfectly casual:</p>

          </h1>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel didn’t answer Sam’s question at first.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She sat still in the chair he’d left, tail curled neatly, but too
            tightly. Her ears had stopped moving.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam blinked, unsure if she’d heard him.
            <br />
            “Hey, it’s okay if you don’t want to—”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I remember the first Flicker,” Vel said.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam stayed quiet.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “She was a teacher,” Vel continued, eyes somewhere far beyond the
            Archive’s walls. “Used to wear bracelets with bells. Said it helped
            her students remember she was human.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A faint breeze lifted the edge of a card on the table.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “She came here once, by accident. During a migraine. Said the pain
            made the world go quiet enough to hear herself think—and what she
            thought scared her.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel shifted. Not dramatically. Just enough that it made Sam feel
            like the chair had gotten colder.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “She didn’t stay. Flickers never do. They slip in when something
            breaks open, then slip out before they notice it’s happened.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam frowned. “You said <em>first.</em> How long—”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel didn’t answer.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable, still sorting cards, didn’t look up. But he said,
            <br />
            “Flickers are the breeze that stirs the door but never walks
            through. You never know if they’ll come back. Most don’t.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel exhaled through her nose. “Some do. Some become Echoes.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She glanced at Sam then, and her voice changed just slightly—like
            someone trying to hand over something delicate without dropping it.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Echoes feel too much to forget. Even if they leave, they leave...
            weight. Threads. Sound that keeps ringing even when the bell is
            gone.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam sat forward. “What are you?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel was quiet for a moment.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Then:</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “You ever say a word so often it loses meaning?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam nodded.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Now imagine being said <em>so many times</em>—felt so deeply—that
            the word becomes something else. Not noise. Not meaning. Just…
            presence.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">She tapped the table.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“That’s a Root.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam’s eyes widened. “So you’re a Root?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel looked down.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            &quot;I don&#39;t know how the Elsebeneath found me. But when it
            did, it never let go.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel reached up onto the table and hopped up with a practiced grace.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I didn’t even look like this when it did.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She sat, tail curling around her paws. The light caught the brass
            telescope at her neck—it gleamed briefly, then dulled.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “At first, I thought I was dead. Or dreaming. But the Elsebeneath
            didn’t <em>feel</em> like either.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam tilted his head. “What did it feel like?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel thought for a long time.
            <br />
            Then: “Like someone had finally asked me the right question. And was
            willing to wait for the answer.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She looked toward the nearest shelf. Not reading the titles. Just…
            listening.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I stayed. Not because I meant to. But because people started
            finding me.
            <br />
            People who’d lost something they couldn’t name.
            <br />
            People who’d been carrying things too long.
            <br />
            People like Gable.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Her voice was soft, but Sam felt the weight of it anyway.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I helped them. I don’t know why. Maybe because I knew what it was
            to ache without language.
            <br />
            And once you help one person let go, it’s hard to stop.
            <br />
            Harder, still, to remember what you were before.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam watched her. He didn’t fidget. Didn’t interrupt.
            <br />
            He just… stared.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel continued.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “After a while, I couldn’t carry it anymore.
            <br />
            So I gave up the part of me that kept asking.
            <br />
            The part that remembered what it was like to be called by name.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">A long pause.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Then Gable’s voice, from the corner:</p>
          <p className="story-text">“She gave me her name.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He wasn’t looking at them—just flipping through a stack of old
            cards.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Wrapped it in a riddle and asked me to forget the answer. I didn’t.
            But the Archive took it anyway.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel’s gaze didn’t leave the table. “That’s how you Root. Not with a
            shout. With a whisper too heavy to lift.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam swallowed. “So this… this cat thing…”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel raised one paw delicately. “I softened. The Archive won’t let
            you vanish—but it’ll let you fade.
            <br />
            And fading into a shape no one expects?
            <br />
            It makes it easier.
            <br />
            To listen.
            <br />
            To leave.
            <br />
            To stay.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable snorted gently. “She’s being poetic. What she means is, she
            turned into an unpaid grief counselor and eventually burned herself
            into the floorboards.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel blinked once. Slowly. “It’s called <em>emotional labor</em>,
            Gable.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “And you’ve got a union rep now, apparently,” he said, nodding
            toward Sam.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam raised a hand, unsure if it was a wave or a solemn vow.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Careful,” Vel said, not looking at him. “You’ll be sorting cards by
            morning.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Outside, one chime stirred. Then stilled again.
            <br />
            Like it had remembered something worth waiting for.
          </p>
          <h1 className="chapter-title">
            Chapter 9: <em>Things Carried</em>
          </h1>
          <p className="story-text">
            The Archive had returned to a quiet rhythm.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Soft footsteps. Shuffling paper. A faint breeze where there
            shouldn’t be one.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel was reorganizing a shelf that hadn’t asked for it.
            <br />
            Gable sat cross-legged on the floor, elbows resting on his knees,
            fingers gently pressing the sides of his temple like he was holding
            something still.
            <br />
            Sam perched on a stool by the window, trying to balance a card on
            its edge and humming a tune no one else recognized.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">The card toppled again.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam sighed dramatically, tried once more, and muttered something
            about center of gravity and emotional sabotage.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel paused mid-reach with a stack of books, ears flicking backward.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I heard that,” she said without turning.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam grinned. “You’re a cat. You hear <em>everything.</em>”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He glanced toward Gable, who hadn’t moved.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Still cross-legged. Still holding his temples like he was trying to
            keep something from spilling out.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The room had settled, but not comfortably.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam slid off his stool, footsteps soft as he crossed the space
            toward Vel.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Has he been like that all morning?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel shifted one book to a different shelf. Then moved it back again.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“On and off,” she said. “Mostly off.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable exhaled through his nose, slow and uneven.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel’s eyes flicked to him.</p>
          <p className="story-text">She opened her mouth. Closed it.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam watched her.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“You want to help,” he said quietly.</p>
          <p className="story-text">She didn’t answer.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            But her tail swayed—not annoyed. Just unsure.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam looked back at Gable, then down at the floor like it might offer
            instructions.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            After a moment, he crouched beside Gable.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“You okay?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable didn’t answer. Not with words.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            His shoulders twitched, just slightly. Like the question had been
            heavier than he expected.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam glanced back. “Vel?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel hesitated. Then padded over, slow.</p>
          <p className="story-text">She didn’t say anything either.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Just sat beside them.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable let out a breath—not a sigh, but close.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I saw his face,” he said suddenly. Voice rough.
            <br />
            “In the stacks. Just for a second. I turned, and he was—”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            His hand moved to his coat pocket.
            <br />
            To the card.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I didn’t remember his name. But I remembered the shape of his mouth
            when he laughed.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel blinked slowly. Then said, almost gently:
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“That’s enough.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable looked at her. Not startled. Just tired.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“No. It’s not.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Then why—”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Because I’ve already given up enough, Vel.”
            <br />
            He looked at her.
            <br />
            “I can’t end up like you.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Then, without fanfare, she spoke:</p>
          <p className="story-text">“I want to help.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">A pause.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Then—
            <br />
            “That’s what you are, isn’t it?” Sam grinned, swinging his legs
            gently from the stool. “You’re a helper.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel didn’t answer.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable did.
            <br />
            “She can’t.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">He turned to Vel with soft eyes.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“But she used to.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel hissed.
            <br />
            “These books just stopped slapping me at random, and you want me to
            go <em>there?</em>”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable nodded once, slow, then turned to Sam.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I’ve been keeping it. Quietly. Not touching it unless she asked.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel’s voice was almost a whisper.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“I never did.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam tilted his head.</p>
          <p className="story-text">&quot;Keeping her what?&quot;</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            &quot;Her name,&quot; Gable said with a wink.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel sighed through her nose. “Names are heavier than people think.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam blinked. “But you still have one, right?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Not in a way I can wear,” she said. “Not in a way that lets me… do
            what I used to do.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable picked at a loose thread on his sleeve.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “She gave it up. All of it. The syllables, the memories, the weight.
            It was the only way she could stop feeling <em>everything.</em>”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam&#39;s face twisted.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Wait. You’re a <em>cat.</em> How does that even—”
            <br />
            He gestured vaguely at her.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel hopped up onto the table. Her paws were quiet. Her voice wasn’t.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “The Elsebeneath doesn’t let go,&quot; she said with a light purr.
            &quot;It just… lets you soften.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            &quot;Into this?&quot; Sam brushed at Vel&#39;s whiskers.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable smiled, just briefly.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Then Sam straightened like a kid who’d just been told it was his
            turn to pull the sword from the stone.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">&quot;Then let&#39;s go get it.&quot;</p>

          <p className="story-text">
            Vel padded back to Sam and sat. Sam stood and started stretching
            like he was seconds from a starting pistol.

          <p className="story-text">
            &quot;It was enough trouble just to get this room to resist her.

            “She’s forgotten so much that a place like this?”

            down his coat.

          <p className="story-text">
            Gable stood near the front hall, one hand resting on a table that
            had never liked staying level. Its legs wobbled in a slow,
            contemplative rhythm.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel was pacing in short lines, tail twitching.
            <br />
            Not annoyed.
            <br />
            Just not ready to sit.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam hovered near the window, notebook in hand, flipping pages like
            they might rearrange themselves into something useful if he looked
            long enough.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Nobody spoke.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Until—</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “We should… do something,” Sam said, voice low. “Before we go down.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable didn’t look up.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “We don’t really know what’s in there, kid.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “So then…” Sam hesitated. “What do people do when they don’t know
            what’s waiting?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel stopped mid-pace.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“They bring what already knows them.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The table shifted beneath Gable’s hand. Not dramatically—just enough
            to remind him it remembered every other time he’d leaned on it.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam stepped forward, eyes scanning the nearby shelves like they
            might volunteer something helpful.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">They didn’t.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He moved to the long table by the entrance. The cards there had
            settled, but one pulsed faintly. He ignored it—for now.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Instead, he reached for the scattered blank ones.
            <br />
            Chose three.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            One he pressed flat against his chest, over the notebook tucked into
            his coat.
            <br />
            One he slid between the notebook’s pages, somewhere near the
            beginning.
            <br />
            The last, he tucked at random into a side pocket.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“That’s not how they work,” Gable said.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam shrugged. “Maybe not for you.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel stepped up beside them. Something was clenched in her mouth—
            <br />a strip of faded ribbon, torn at one edge, still holding a
            faint shimmer of scent. Honeysuckle and salt.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam looked at her.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“You’re bringing that?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">She dropped it in his palm.</p>
          <p className="story-text">He blinked.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“…For me?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel didn’t answer. Just sat, tail curling in a slow, deliberate
            shape.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable watched from a distance.
            <br />
            Didn’t interfere.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam bent down, met Vel’s eyes.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He tied the ribbon in a loose knot around her foreleg. Just above
            the paw. No bow. Just a single loop. The bowline his dad taught him.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Now it remembers you,” he said softly.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel blinked once. Said nothing.</p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            Gable turned toward the hallway.
            <br />
            The crooked placard still hung there:
          </p>
          <blockquote className="story-callout">
            <p className="story-text">

            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p className="story-text">He looked back at them.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“You ready?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam nodded.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel didn’t move.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Then—</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Yes. But I’m not going first.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable almost smiled.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“That’s fair.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam stepped forward.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            And the sign above them flickered.
            <br />
            The words rearranged themselves.

          <blockquote className="story-callout">

            Grinned.

          <p className="story-text">“Cool.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">He reached for the door.</p>

            And somewhere, tucked on a forgotten shelf, a book titled{" "}

            It was slow. Wandering. Uneasy.

            Like a thought trying to finish itself.

          <p className="story-text">
            Sam followed Vel through a narrowing corridor that refused to stay
            still.

            The air shimmered. The shelves thinned.
            <br />
            Books began to appear at strange angles—some half-open, some
            mid-sentence, some breathing.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">He blinked. A page inhaled.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Another book, wedged into the crook of the wall, exhaled dust and an

            “I don’t think these are shelved properly,” Sam whispered.

            The air that had been sharp before was now unstable, like it had

            Her form shimmered, caught between shapes. Sometimes a wolf.
            Sometimes something else. Something older. A silhouette made of
            forgetting—a shape remembered from the wrong angle.
          </p>

          <p className="story-text">And instantly staggered.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The space around her was <em>wrong</em>. Slippery. Not quite space.
            Not quite thought. A field of distortion that turned his own
            memories into feedback. He felt dizzy. Disoriented. Like his
            heartbeat had suddenly become out of sync with the room.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Vel—” he tried. But even saying her name made the air twitch, like
            it wasn’t sure that was still accurate.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She let out a low, rasping sound—not a growl, not a word. Something
            in between. Her eyes were glowing faintly, but they weren’t focused.
            Not on him. Not on anything.

            Drawn in blue ink, a little smeared at the edges.

            Vel stayed motionless, paw still resting on the star chart. Her form
            no longer flickered. Her breath came quiet now—through a real chest,
            in a real shape, held together by something more than memory.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">She didn’t speak for a long time.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            When she did, her voice was soft enough that the Archive leaned in
            to hear it.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “That notebook doesn’t show where you’ve been,” she said, eyes still
            on the drawing.
            <br />
            “It shows what mattered enough to remember.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam nodded, too full to speak.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The light from the page continued to glow steadily.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Even here, in the deepest corners of forgetting, the stars were
            still enough to be heard.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">They walked again.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Not far.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Just enough for the air to shift. For the silence to gather weight.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Then Vel spoke again.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “When I left my name here,” she said, “I thought it would protect
            me. I thought forgetting would mean I didn’t have to hurt.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Her voice didn’t break. It just hollowed.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “But the longer I stayed away, the less I could even name what I was
            missing.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            She looked down at the shelves beside her. The endless books. The
            borrowed stories.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “You can’t hold something from a distance forever,” she said.
            <br />
            “Meaning unravels without presence.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam didn’t answer.</p>
          <p className="story-text">There was nothing to fix.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Just something to carry.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            And the Archive, quiet now, let them go on.

            The air deepened. The light folded inward.

            The gravity of the place turned <em>outward</em>—away from her.

            Like her presence had been stretched into memory-light, carried

          <p className="story-text">
            The floor stretched beneath his feet.

            Corridors elongated.
            <br />
            Doors bloomed and closed like thoughts mid-regret.

            Flickering. Unstable.
            <br />
            Her shape stuttering through versions of herself—wolf, woman, girl,
            storm, echo.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The space between them became unbearable.
            <br />
            She writhed through it—shifting, unraveling, reforming.

          <p className="story-text">
            He could barely hear her voice over the ache of it.

            She stepped toward him, every footfall sewing memory back into her

            Not healed.

          <p className="story-text">Waiting.</p>
          <p className="story-text">And then she stopped.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Mid-step.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The floor beneath her shimmered faintly.

            It folded beneath her feet like sand giving way to something deeper.

          <p className="story-text">She looked down.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Her paws were still paws—but they flickered now, shifting at the

            Not confused.
            <br />

            The pressure of a headwrap drawn snug beneath the sun.

            The heavy sweep of her arms cutting through heat and song.

          <p className="story-text">
            In awe.

          <p className="story-text">
            The Archive didn’t roar or weep or shimmer.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">It just… made space.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Shelves adjusted, pages tucked in tighter, titles updated in
            invisible script.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            No fanfare.
            <br />
            Just <strong>truth</strong>, refiled where it belonged.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel closed her eyes.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “When I gave it my name,” she said, “I asked it to hold the pain I
            couldn’t anymore.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">She opened them again.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “And it did.
            <br />
            But it held the rest, too.”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            The path ahead revealed itself without drama.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            No glowing floor tiles.
            <br />
            No whispered instructions.
            <br />
            Just a hallway that now trusted them to walk it.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel took one step forward.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Then paused.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Turned slightly.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Not to say anything.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Just to make sure Sam was still there.</p>
          <p className="story-text">He was.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He tucked the notebook under his arm, like someone closing a journal
            with love instead of finality.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Let’s go,” he said.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel nodded once.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Then walked beside him.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Not as a guide.
            <br />
            Not as a guardian.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">As someone walking home.</p>
          <h1 className="chapter-title">

          </h1>
          <p className="story-text">
            The Archive didn’t announce their return.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            No fanfare. No chimes.
            <br />
            Just a door that opened quietly.
            <br />
            And a hallway that remembered how to lead them back.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable was waiting.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Still by the desk.
            <br />
            Still holding posture like it was a defense.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Then he looked up.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Really looked.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            And something inside him <strong>broke open.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Not the jagged kind.
            <br />
            The soft kind.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">The kind that lets light in.</p>
          <p className="story-text">He stepped forward.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “You came back,” he said, voice barely above breath.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel nodded.
            <br />
            She smiled.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“You stayed.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">That undid him.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He laughed once—sharp, breathless, startled by how close it sounded
            to a sob.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“I didn’t know how to leave.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel reached out. Touched his shoulder.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Light. Steady. Real.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Maybe now you don’t have to carry it alone.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable didn’t answer.</p>
          <p className="story-text">But he cried.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Not facing a drawer.
            <br />
            Not a book.
            <br />
            Not the wind.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He cried with <strong>someone beside him.</strong>
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            Later—minutes? moments?—Sam pulled something from his coat.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">A card.</p>
          <p className="story-text">The one from the beginning.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The one that had waited, patient as a memory that knew it would be
            needed eventually.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">He handed it to Gable.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Was it the kind you meant to say?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Gable looked at it for a long time.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Then—quietly, deliberately—slid it into the Archive.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“It is now.”</p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel stood nearby, eyes soft, voice softer.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “You didn’t need to speak it.
            <br />
            The wind carried it anyway.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            And this time, the Archive didn’t catalog.
            <br />
            Didn’t process.
            <br />
            Didn’t sort.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">It simply… welcomed it home.</p>
          <h1 className="chapter-title">
            Chapter 16: <em>Things Made New</em>
          </h1>
          <p className="story-text">The Elsebeneath exhaled.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Not loudly.
            <br />
            Not all at once.
            <br />
            Just enough for the air to remember how to move again.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A breeze slipped between shutters, shy and curious—
            <br />
            stirring the loose corners of notes never finished,
            <br />
            nudging ribbons that had forgotten they were supposed to dance.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The wind was back.
            <br />
            Not singing yet.
            <br />
            But humming.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Soft. Off-key.
            <br />
            Learning the tune again.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">The chimes followed.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            A few rang clearly.
            <br />
            One let out a joyful clang like it had been waiting for this moment
            specifically to make a scene.
            <br />
            Another jingled like it had lost a bet.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel stood near the door of the Archive.
            <br />
            Human again. Stillness curling around her shoulders like a familiar
            shawl.
            <br />
            She tucked a lock of hair behind her ear for the first time in
            longer than she could name.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam watched her do it.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “…You look different in the light,” he said.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">She raised an eyebrow. “Better?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">“Whole.”</p>
          <p className="story-text">That earned a small smile.</p>
          <p className="story-text">He took a slow step forward.</p>
          <p className="story-text">“So... this is the end?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Vel turned toward the open door.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Outside, the ribbons fluttered.
            <br />
            Some even lifted—just slightly—like they were remembering how to
            leap.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“No,” she said.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “This is a beginning.
            <br />
            But you have to speak it for yourself.”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">
            That’s when the door banged open like it had never learned manners.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Fen barrelled through with the full energy of someone who believed
            every room was just a stage waiting to be caught mid-monologue.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“WHAT did I MISS?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam blinked.
            <br />
            “...Fen?”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Fen pointed at Vel. “You’re taller.”
            <br />
            Then at Sam. “You look like you’ve been emotionally excavated.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Then he flopped dramatically against the table, limbs splayed, like
            a question mark that had decided punctuation was a group project.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Seriously. What did I miss?”</p>
          <p className="story-text">Sam stared.</p>
          <p className="story-text">Then laughed.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Then rubbed the back of his neck, sheepish.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “I’m sorry,” he said.
            <br />
            “For leaving you behind. Back at the Mountain.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">Fen looked up.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            The grin faded—just a little.
            <br />
            “Eh. You’re here now.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">A beat.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            “Besides,” Fen added, hopping to his feet again, “if I were needed
            earlier, I would’ve been. That’s how Elsebeneath works. It doesn’t
            forget. It just... waits for resonance.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            He pointed both thumbs at himself. “And I resonate <em>loudly.</em>”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Vel groaned. “Like a kazoo in a cathedral.”
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">“Exactly!” Fen beamed.</p>
          <hr />
          <p className="story-text">They stepped outside together.</p>
          <p className="story-text">The wind greeted them.</p>
          <p className="story-text">This time, it carried more than hush.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            It carried a hum.
            <br />A question.
            <br />
            The shape of a word not spoken yet—
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">—but already beginning to echo.</p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Sam looked up at the sky, its color still forgetting itself.
