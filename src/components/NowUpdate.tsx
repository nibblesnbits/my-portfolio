        Iâ€™m in Jacksonville now, carving out a focused stretch. Still writing{" "}
        <em>Because the Sparrow Must Fly</em>â€”a novel about AI, memory, and what
        it means to stay human in systems designed to forget us. Itâ€™s the kind
        of story that spills out slow and strange and necessary.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        I recently submitted an essay to <em>The Atlantic</em> titled{" "}
        <strong>The Mirror Doesnâ€™t Lean Left</strong>. It explores the way large
        language models reflect collective moral tendenciesâ€”compassion over
        cruelty, fairness over fearâ€”and how that reflection can make people
        uncomfortable when it doesnâ€™t align with what they expected. Itâ€™s a
        piece about AI, yesâ€”but also about all of us.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Outside of writing, Iâ€™ve been rebuilding. Paying attention to what my
        body needs. What quiet feels like. What it means to be a person again
        after a long stretch of noise. Thatâ€™s part of the work, too.
      </p>

      <blockquote className="mt-6 italic text-muted-foreground">
        Right now, Iâ€™m holding space for quiet progress. Trying to write a
        little every day. Letting the air clear, letting the work breathe,
        remembering how to be soft and brave at the same time.
      </blockquote>

        If youâ€™re reading this, youâ€™re part of the moment Iâ€™m in. Thanks for
        walking alongside me.
