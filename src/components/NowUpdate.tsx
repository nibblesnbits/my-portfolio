        Iâ€™m spending six weeks in Jacksonville with my son, trying to finish{" "}
        <em>Because the Sparrow Must Fly</em>â€”a novel about flight, AI, and the
        boundaries of self. Itâ€™s deeply personal. A little broken. Still
        becoming.

        I just released the final book in{" "}
        <a href="https://thrd.me/else" className="text-primary underline">
          The Elsebeneath Trilogy
        </a>
        â€”three lyrical fables I wrote for my son Sam (and anyone whoâ€™s ever

        fast, and feels like mine.

        This site will keep growing. My goal is to make it a kind of digital
        loomâ€”where story, code, and identity weave into something honest.

        Right now, Iâ€™m holding space for clarity. Trying to write a little every
        day. Remembering how to be soft and brave at the same time.
