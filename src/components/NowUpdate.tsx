        Iâ€™m in Jacksonville now, settled in for a focused stretch, working on{" "}
        <em>Because the Sparrow Must Fly</em>â€”a novel about flight, AI, and the
        edges of self. Itâ€™s deeply personal. Still a little broken. Still
        becoming.

        I recently wrapped the final book in{" "}
        <a href="https://thrd.me/else" className="text-primary underline">
          The Elsebeneath Trilogy
        </a>
        â€”three lyrical fables I wrote for my son Sam (and anyone whoâ€™s ever
        needed help finding their way back to trying).

        On the tech side, I built{" "}
        <a href="https://thrd.me" className="text-primary underline">
          thrd.me
        </a>
        â€”a tiny, fast, personal shortlink service powered by Cloudflare Workers.
        It feels like mine. It feels like a thread I wanted to pull through the
        internet.

      <p className="mt-4">
        This site will keep growing. My aim is still the same: to build a kind
        of digital loomâ€”where story, code, and identity weave into something
        honest.

        Right now, Iâ€™m holding space for quiet progress. Trying to write a
        little every day. Letting the air clear, letting the work breathe,
        remembering how to be soft and brave at the same time.
