        I don't know if Iâ€™ll return to it. I might. But if I donâ€™t, Iâ€™ve made
        peace with that. Itâ€™s no longer mine to hold constantlyâ€”it belongs to
        anyone whoâ€™s ever wandered inside it, even briefly. It belongs to you,
        if youâ€™ve ever felt seen by its echoes.

      <p className="mt-4">
        Right now, Iâ€™m working on rebuilding real things: my home, my focus, my
        future. Iâ€™m trying to find structure againâ€”not in narrative, but in
        breath and body and rhythm. Thatâ€™s its own kind of story.

        the way with me. The doors are still there, even if Iâ€™m not on the other
