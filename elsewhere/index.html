that state and time<br/>that caused a spoon to change its mind.<br/>(And possibly its job. It’s management now.)</p><h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: <em>The Errand</em></h1><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text"><em>“Just Return the Ribbon, He Said.”</em></p></blockquote><hr/><p class="story-text">Sam wasn’t entirely sure what the errand <em>was</em>.</p><p class="story-text">Something about a ribbon. Or a chime. Or maybe a chime <em>with</em> <!-- -->a ribbon attached to it.<br/>Fen had explained it, sort of, but the explanation had included a diagram made out of spoon handles and the phrase<!-- --> <strong>“emotionally borrowed, not legally borrowed”</strong>—so Sam had chosen not to press.</p><p class="story-text">The path was clear, at least.<br/>A straight walk, a single right turn, and a polite knock on a door that might be a door but also might be a large wardrobe pretending to be a door for tax reasons.</p><p class="story-text">Sam sighed.<br/>Simple.</p><p class="story-text">Which is, of course, when Fen said:</p><p class="story-text">“Shortcut.”</p><p class="story-text">It wasn’t really a suggestion.<br/>He’d already veered left—off the path, around a hedge that looked like it had opinions about foot traffic, and into a field that was definitely wider than it had been ten seconds ago.</p><p class="story-text">Sam stood there, one eyebrow gently ascending.</p><p class="story-text">“Shortcut,” he repeated flatly.</p><p class="story-text">Fen turned, walking backward with his arms out like a conductor leading an orchestra of invisible bees.</p><p class="story-text">“The long way is overrated. Full of… expectation. Linear tension. Exposition. You <em>don’t</em> want that.”</p><p class="story-text">“I kind of do.”</p><p class="story-text">“Too late! We’re pivoting.”</p><p class="story-text">And that was the last rational thing either of them said for quite a while.</p><hr/><p class="story-text">The shimmer was subtle.</p><p class="story-text">A quick flicker—like the world had blinked and come back with the saturation turned slightly wrong.<br/>The grass went from green to<em>ambitiously chartreuse</em>. The sky hiccuped.<br/>The wind made a sound like someone trying to whistle with soup in their mouth.</p><p class="story-text">Then the field folded.</p><p class="story-text">Not dramatically.<br/>Just… a gentle crease. Like the Elsebeneath had gotten distracted and accidentally sat on this corner of itself.</p><p class="story-text">The horizon tilted.<br/>The colors held their breath.<br/>Somewhere far off, a duck quacked in what might’ve been Morse code.</p><p class="story-text">And just like that—</p><p class="story-text"><strong>they were Elsewhere.</strong></p><hr/><p class="story-text">The path behind them had vanished.<br/>The air smelled faintly of chalk, indecision, and extremely old bubblegum.</p><p class="story-text">Sam looked around.</p><p class="story-text">The trees were square now.<br/>A few rotated slowly, like they were reviewing the scene for continuity errors.<br/>Off to the right, a single boot floated six feet off the ground, emitting a low hum of passive judgment.</p><p class="story-text">Sam turned to Fen.<br/>Fen was already chewing something he hadn’t been holding two seconds ago.</p><p class="story-text">“Where did that come from?”</p><p class="story-text">“It was humming.”<br/>Fen held up the snack—something between a pastry and a musical regret. “I figured it was edible.”</p><p class="story-text">Sam stared at him.<br/>Then he sighed, again. Deeply. Professionally.</p><p class="story-text">“...So this isn’t the shortcut.”</p><p class="story-text">Fen grinned.</p><p class="story-text">“Nope. It’s the scenic route for people with bad luck and excellent instincts.”</p><p class="story-text">The wind nudged them forward with the soft confidence of a story that didn’t know how it ended—but<em>was absolutely sure it would be worth it.</em></p><p class="story-text">They walked.</p><p class="story-text">The boot followed.<br/>Just in case.</p><h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: <em>Entry Conditions</em></h1><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text"><em>“If You Find the Door, Please Don’t Knock.”</em></p></blockquote><hr/><p class="story-text">The field gave up trying to be a field about ten steps in.</p><p class="story-text">What had once been grass became... suggestion. Texture without texture. A soft carpet of maybe.</p><p class="story-text">The path narrowed, except it hadn’t had a width before, and now it was just <em>less than everything else</em> around it.<br/>Like it was being shy.</p><p class="story-text">Ahead, the world curled inward.</p><p class="story-text">Sam blinked.</p><p class="story-text">Then blinked again.</p><p class="story-text">The hallway—if you could call it that—was doing its best impression of a Möbius strip that had read about hallways in a dream.<br/>It bent. Folded. Inverted once. Then re-inverted itself apologetically.<br/>Doors hung at 45° angles. Steps looped into ceilings. A bench whispered to a broom about missed opportunities.</p><p class="story-text">Sam squinted.</p><p class="story-text">“Are we upside-down?”</p><p class="story-text">“Emotionally, maybe,” said Fen.</p><p class="story-text">They stepped inside.</p><hr/><p class="story-text">The moment they crossed the threshold, the air snapped like a book being closed mid-sentence.</p><p class="story-text">A small brass plaque shimmered into existence on a floating pedestal. It adjusted its height to match Sam’s eyeline, then winked out and reappeared at Fen’s shoulder instead.</p><p class="story-text">It read:</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text"><strong>WELCOME TO THE QUADRANT OF ERRANT ECHOES</strong></p><p class="story-text"><em>Exit Conditions:</em></p><ol class="numbered-list"><li>Misremember something important.</li><li>Misstate something obvious.</li><li>Mispronounce yourself, with intent.</li><li>Regret none of it.</li></ol><p class="story-text"><strong>To leave, follow your mistakes.</strong><br/>Please do not knock. The doors are sensitive.</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">Sam stared at it.</p><p class="story-text">“So we’re trapped in a metaphor.”</p><p class="story-text">Fen nodded solemnly.</p><p class="story-text">“That’s the Elsebeneath, baby.”</p><p class="story-text">The hallway folded again. This time <em>toward</em> them.</p><p class="story-text">A door appeared to their left.<br/>It had no handle, but it<em>judged</em> them with the full force of a forgotten birthday.</p><p class="story-text">Sam stepped toward it.</p><p class="story-text">Fen threw an arm out.</p><p class="story-text">“Nope. Rule three. You’ve got to mispronounce <em>yourself</em>.”</p><p class="story-text">Sam blinked. “What?”</p><p class="story-text">Fen gestured grandly to the air, as if quoting a sacred text no one else could see.</p><p class="story-text">“Mispronounce yourself—with intent.”</p><p class="story-text">“How do you mispronounce—”<br/>“Say your name wrong. But on<em>purpose.</em>”</p><p class="story-text">Sam paused.</p><p class="story-text">“Slam?”</p><p class="story-text">The door groaned.<br/>A hinge quivered.<br/>A very faint sigh escaped from somewhere in the wall, like a tired librarian refusing to be impressed.</p><p class="story-text">The door opened one inch.<br/>Then stopped.<br/>Then sneezed.</p><p class="story-text">And closed again.</p><p class="story-text">Fen nodded, approvingly. “Not bad. You just didn’t <em>mean it.</em>”</p><p class="story-text">“How do I—how does someone <em>mean</em> Slam?!”</p><p class="story-text">“Be Slam. Embrace Slam. Think with Slam energy.”</p><p class="story-text">Sam opened his mouth.<br/>Then closed it.<br/>Then opened it again and very quietly muttered:</p><p class="story-text">“...I am Slam.”</p><p class="story-text">Nothing happened.</p><p class="story-text">Fen cleared his throat, stepped forward, and said loudly:</p><p class="story-text">“I AM FOON.”</p><p class="story-text">The walls shivered.</p><p class="story-text">The floor said, <em>“What.”</em></p><p class="story-text">The door exploded into glitter.</p><p class="story-text">Beyond it lay another room.<br/>Sort of.</p><p class="story-text">It was like a hallway caught mid-molting.<br/>Bits of sentence-fragment carpet sloughed off into corners. One wall was made of unfinished diary entries. The ceiling was a series of half-remembered jokes, muttering to themselves about better punchlines.</p><p class="story-text">Sam stepped inside carefully.</p><p class="story-text">The plaque floated after them. Its lettering adjusted to read:</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“Progress acknowledged.<br/>Next mistake, please.”</p></blockquote><hr/><p class="story-text">They walked.</p><p class="story-text">The corridor pulsed once.</p><p class="story-text">Somewhere far off, a wind laughed without explanation.</p><hr/><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text"><strong>Footnote, probably:</strong><br/><em>The Quadrant of Errant Echoes does not endorse shouting your own name incorrectly as a means of psychological advancement. However, if it helps you find the hallway, we won’t stop you. We<em>might</em> giggle.</em></p></blockquote><h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: <em>The Buffet of Unfinished Thoughts</em></h1><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text"><em>“Regret Comes with a Side of Breadcrumbs”</em></p></blockquote><hr/><p class="story-text">The corridor eventually gave up trying to be a corridor and just opened into a room that looked like it had once been a restaurant, then forgotten how.</p><p class="story-text">There were tables, mostly. Some chairs.<br/>One chandelier dangled from the ceiling by a ribbon labeled<strong>“DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR THIS”</strong>, and another sat politely on the floor, humming to itself in C minor.</p><p class="story-text">A sign near the entrance flickered into legibility.</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text"><strong>WELCOME TO THE BUFFET OF UNFINISHED THOUGHTS</strong><br/><em>Today’s Special: Regret.</em></p><p class="story-text">No menus. No substitutions.<br/>Please chew your intentions thoroughly.<br/>DING if you forgot why you came.</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">A small bell rested on each table, glowing softly.<br/>Sam passed one that bore the engraved phrase:<br/><strong>“For guests haunted by things that were almost clever.”</strong></p><p class="story-text">Fen, naturally, dinged it.</p><hr/><p class="story-text">The waitress arrived almost immediately.<br/>She was seven feet tall, wore a waitress uniform made of punctuation marks, and floated four inches off the ground. Her face was mostly jellyfish.<br/>She handed them each a folded napkin and spoke in perfect sentence fragments:</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“Choices irrelevant.”<br/>“Order placed already.”<br/>“Digestive discomfort optional.”</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">Then she vanished behind a curtain made entirely of overdue library cards.</p><p class="story-text">Sam turned to Fen.</p><p class="story-text">“You’ve been here before?”</p><p class="story-text">“Once. Maybe. Could’ve been a dream about a courtroom. Same vibe.”</p><p class="story-text">“Did you eat anything?”</p><p class="story-text">“Not intentionally.”</p><p class="story-text">Their food arrived instantly.</p><p class="story-text">In front of Sam:<br/>A plate holding what appeared to be the<em>exact</em> moment you forget what you walked into a room for—garnished with a sprinkle of false confidence.</p><p class="story-text">He picked up the fork.<br/>The food evaporated into a feeling of unresolved conversations and mild neck tension.</p><p class="story-text">He sighed.</p><p class="story-text">“This tastes like being interrupted halfway through a sentence and then never—”</p><p class="story-text">“Exactly,” said Fen, chewing thoughtfully on something that looked like a waffle made of old birthday wishes.</p><p class="story-text">“What’s yours?”</p><p class="story-text">Fen glanced down at his plate.<br/>It had changed shape three times in the last minute.</p><p class="story-text">“I think it’s... the time I tried to be honest, but accidentally used sarcasm instead.”<br/>He held up a bite. It sparkled, then wept.<br/>“Tastes like pomegranate and disappointing eye contact.”</p><hr/><p class="story-text">A busboy passed by, entirely composed of index cards. One fell off and fluttered to Sam’s feet.</p><p class="story-text">It read:</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text"><em>“You said it didn’t matter, but you didn’t mean it. Would you like to try again?”</em></p></blockquote><p class="story-text">Sam folded it and slid it into his pocket.<br/>Just in case.</p><hr/><p class="story-text">The waitress returned.</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“Dessert?”<br/>“Today’s is whatever you meant to say last week.”</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">Fen raised a hand.</p><p class="story-text">“I didn’t mean to say anything last week.”</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“Exactly,” she replied, and handed him an empty plate.</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">Sam declined.</p><p class="story-text">“I’m full,” he said, though it came out more like <em>tired</em>.</p><p class="story-text">The jellyfish bowed, nodded, curtsied (twice), and faded into static.</p><hr/><p class="story-text">As they left the restaurant, a new bell appeared above the door.<br/>It rang itself once, politely.</p><p class="story-text">Sam looked up.</p><p class="story-text">“What was that one for?”</p><p class="story-text">Fen shrugged.</p><p class="story-text">“Could’ve been gratitude. Could’ve been indigestion.”<br/>“Hard to tell the difference in here.”</p><p class="story-text">They stepped back into the corridor.</p><p class="story-text">The plaque was waiting.</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“Mistake logged.<br/>Continue.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text"><strong>Footnote from the Host:</strong><br/><em>We regret to inform you that the buffet is not liable for any lingering metaphors. Please do not attempt to translate your entrée into closure. Some thoughts are served best unfinished.</em></p></blockquote><h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4: <em>REDACTED</em></h1><p class="story-text"><em>“Because the author—”</em></p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">This section has been temporarily withheld due to narrative instability, emotional oversaturation, and a mild jellyfish-related incident.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">The room was shaped like a— ████████████████████████████</p><p class="story-text">Sam turned to Fen and said, “███████████████████████████████.”</p><p class="story-text">Fen replied, “That’s the worst idea you’ve had since the teacup incident.”<br/>Then he paused. “Wait. That was <em>this.</em> This is the teacup incident.<br/>We’re <em>in it.</em>”</p><p class="story-text">The walls pulsed. One of them whispered something offensive about punctuation.<br/>The mirror screamed and turned into a baguette.<br/>No one addressed it.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">[AUTHOR’S NOTE: This chapter was written during a moment of high emotional volatility, three misplaced metaphors, and one existential sandwich.

More like a decision.</p><p class="story-text">Ahead: a room made of mirrors.</p><p class="story-text">Not <strong>lined</strong> with mirrors—<em>made</em> of them.<br/>Ceiling, floor, walls, corners, air. Reflective. Refractive.<br/>Like the world was trying to remember itself and kept getting the angles wrong.</p><p class="story-text">They stepped inside.</p><p class="story-text">Immediately, their reflections disagreed with them.</p><hr/><p class="story-text">One version of Sam stormed past, shoulders rigid, shouting at Vel—words Sam hadn’t said.<br/>Not exactly.</p><p class="story-text">Another showed him running away from Gable’s grief.<br/>Not walking.<strong>Running.</strong> Cowardice written into the motion.</p><p class="story-text">Sam flinched.</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“That’s not—”</p></blockquote><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“Correct,” said Fen. “It’s not.”</p></blockquote><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“But I—”</p></blockquote><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“Didn’t. Or not like that. These aren’t mirrors. They’re drafts. Echoes with opinions.”</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">Sam turned to look at him.<br/>Fen was watching himself in one of the panes:<br/>crying.<br/>Alone.<br/>Bent at the knees on a frozen mountaintop, screaming into snow that didn’t echo back.</p><p class="story-text">Fen stared at it. Then tilted his head.</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“I don’t cry like that,” he muttered.<br/>“I cry in trees. Get it right.”</p></blockquote><hr/><p class="story-text">Then the room shifted.</p><p class="story-text">The reflections snapped into sync.</p><p class="story-text">The mirrors stopped showing misremembered maybes—and instead started<em>asking questions.</em></p><p class="story-text">The mirror in front of Sam flashed once.<br/>Then: a scene.</p><p class="story-text">His old bedroom.<br/>Vel on the floor.<br/>His voice—<strong>angry. Clear.</strong><br/>This time, it was a real memory.</p><p class="story-text">Only this version... rewrote itself.</p><p class="story-text">Sam stood straighter.<br/>Said the perfect thing.<br/>Stopped the fight before it even began.</p><p class="story-text">The air went still.</p><hr/><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“What’s happening?”</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">Fen’s voice came from somewhere behind a thousand Sam-reflections.</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“Rewrites,” he said. “The Elsebeneath’s most dangerous illusion.”<br/>“It doesn’t show you lies.

Narrowed his eyes.</p><p class="story-text">“Do you… live here?”</p><p class="story-text">The man nodded. “More or less.”</p><p class="story-text">“Are you from the village?”</p><p class="story-text">“No,” he said. “I’m from… before the village.”</p><p class="story-text">He stood and poured tea without asking.<br/>Set three cups on the table.</p><p class="story-text">Then, as he sat again, he said—</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">“I’m Graham.”</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">Sam <strong>froze.</strong></p><p class="story-text">His hands twitched—<strong>scarf.</strong> Where’s the scarf.<br/>He reached for it. Felt nothing. Blinked hard.</p><p class="story-text">Fen noticed. “You okay?”</p><p class="story-text">Sam opened his mouth. Then closed it.</p><p class="story-text">“I gave it to Gable,” he said softly.</p><p class="story-text">Graham looked up. His expression didn’t change—but something behind his eyes shifted.<br/>Not menace. Not delight.</p><p class="story-text">Just... memory.</p><p class="story-text">“That was kind of you,” he said.</p><p class="story-text">Sam stared.</p><p class="story-text">“You’re real.”</p><p class="story-text">Graham tilted his head. “So are you.”</p><p class="story-text">A pause. Long enough for the tea to cool slightly.</p><p class="story-text">Fen looked between them. “So, uh.<br/>What’s the catch here? Are you going to disappear in a puff of closure?<br/>Or challenge us to a riddle duel? Or whisper something haunting that doesn’t resolve until book seven?”</p><p class="story-text">Graham smiled.</p><p class="story-text">“I’m just going to pour the tea.”</p><p class="story-text">And he did.</p><p class="story-text">They drank in silence for a while.<br/>Sam kept glancing at the scarf that wasn’t there.<br/>Fen tapped a rhythm on the table with one finger, like he was testing the emotional acoustics.</p><p class="story-text">Eventually, Sam spoke again.</p><p class="story-text">“You’re not what I expected.”</p><p class="story-text">Graham nodded.</p><p class="story-text">“I hope that’s a good thing.”</p><hr/><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text"><em>Some memories arrive late.<br/>Others were here first.</em><br/><em>But all of them—eventually—<br/>ask to be met again.</em></p></blockquote></div><br/><p class="mt-6 mb-2 text-center text-muted-foreground">I&#x27;d love to hear what moments mattered most to you.</p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQARjat_oEJ9cNEb1fzWJaNyRRP6n44WkeydZRub3VvCmXoA/viewform?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=112014812140367339055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-lg bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground font-medium hover:opacity-90 transition mb-4">💭 Share What Stayed With You</a><br/><br/><a href="https://elsebeneath.online" class="inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-lg bg-primary text-primary-foreground font-medium hover:opacity-90 transition">🔙 Return Home</a></div><div class="row py-2 lg:py-0 items-center flex-wrap-reverse"><div class="text-center lg:col-6 lg:mb-0 lg:text-left"><ul><li class="m-2 inline-block">© Juno Threadborne 2025<!-- --> <a href="https://thrd.me/mirror">✨</a></li></ul></div><div class="text-center lg:col-6 lg:my-0 flex items-center justify-center lg:justify-end"><div class="kofi-button"><a href="https://thrd.me/tip" type="button" class="text-white bg-[#3b5998] font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center inline-flex items-center dark:focus:ring-[#3b5998]/55 me-2 mb-2"><img src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/logomarkLogo.png" alt="Ko-fi donations"/> Fuel the Next Chapter</a></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </main>  <script>
