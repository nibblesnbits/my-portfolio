class="story-text"><em>A Said-So Academy Story</em></p><p class="story-text">by Juno Threadborne</p><p class="story-text"><em>Listen to the Audiobook (with music provided by<!-- --> <a class="underline" href="https://pixabay.com/users/9096471/">Geoff Harvey</a>).</em></p><audio controls="" class="w-full mb-4"><source src="/audio/hair.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio><br/><hr/><br/><p class="story-text">At Said-So Academy, everything was in its place. That was the point of the place.<br/>The uniforms matched. The clocks agreed. The grass outside was precisely short enough to whisper &quot;controlled environment&quot; without seeming military about it. Even the silence between class bells felt‚Ä¶ <em>tucked in.</em></p><p class="story-text">Which is why Ms. Thomas always stood out‚Äînot because she broke the rules, but because she bent them into more interesting shapes.</p><p class="story-text">She had the kind of presence that made ceilings feel too low. Her hair was usually tied back with a pencil‚Äîjust a pencil, mind you‚Äîbut she wielded it like a wand disguised as a tool. It spun when she thought, flicked when she disagreed, and somehow never fell out, even when she walked with purpose (which was always).</p><p class="story-text">Fen watched her the way you might watch a thunderstorm blooming far away across a valley. Not fearful. Not fascinated, exactly. Just<!-- --> <em>aware</em> in a way you couldn‚Äôt explain afterward.</p><p class="story-text">To most people, she was a student. A clever one. Two years ahead in everything and somehow still likable.</p><p class="story-text">But to Fen?</p><p class="story-text">She was the only person in the building who moved like she belonged to more than one world.</p><p class="story-text">Which, as someone who <em>actually</em> did, he found terribly appealing.</p><p class="story-text">Fen had, after all, spent most of his life inside a place that didn‚Äôt show up on maps. The Elsebeneath had been his home, his neighborhood, his playground, and his prison for‚Ä¶ well, for however long it had been. Time down there tended to lose track of itself, and Fen was not one to argue with clocks.</p><p class="story-text">But then came Sam.<br/>And Sam had made things‚Ä¶ <em>sticky.</em></p><p class="story-text">And so did Ms. Thomas.</p><p class="story-text">&quot;Fen?&quot;</p><p class="story-text">A hand waved lazily in front of his face. The kind of wave that said<!-- --> <em>this isn‚Äôt the first attempt</em> and<!-- --> <em>also I‚Äôm enjoying this.</em></p><p class="story-text">&quot;Fennnn.&quot;</p><p class="story-text">Fen blinked, still staring down the hallway.</p><p class="story-text">&quot;Are you in there, bud?&quot;</p><p class="story-text">He inhaled sharply. ‚ÄúNo. Yes? I‚Äôm just‚Äî‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">He shook his head, still blinking like someone who‚Äôd just woken from a vision quest.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI was <em>observing!</em>‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam gave him a look.</p><p class="story-text">Fen turned fully now, eyes wide with conviction. His expression hovered somewhere between indignation and enchantment‚Äîlike a bard who‚Äôd been interrupted mid-ballad and was trying to decide whether to finish the song or start a revolution.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúShe had her hair <em>down,</em> Sam.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThere was this one strand,‚Äù Fen continued, softer now. ‚ÄúJust one. Right near her temple. It kept falling the wrong way. She pushed it back twice. Tucked it behind her ear, and it still came loose.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">He paused.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúSomething about it just‚Ä¶ made everything feel real. Like, here‚Äôs this person who‚Äôs completely brilliant and unstoppable and terrifyingly composed‚Äîand there‚Äôs this one hair that won‚Äôt fall in line.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam blinked.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúDude. It‚Äôs just a hair.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen nodded solemnly.<br/>‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam sighed, deeply. ‚ÄúDo I want to know who we‚Äôre talking about, or should I just assume it‚Äôs the same person it‚Äôs been for three weeks?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúFour,‚Äù Fen said softly.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúRight.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam leaned back against a locker, arms crossed, watching his friend like a person watching a firework who knew it was going to explode just a <em>little</em> too close.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYou do realize she‚Äôs, like, a full human being, right?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWith opinions? And homework? And, like, the ability to say no?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not proposing,‚Äù Fen said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm <em>not even approaching.</em> <!-- -->I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ marveling.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam pinched the bridge of his nose. &quot;You do remember she&#x27;s a teacher, right?&quot;</p><p class="story-text">Fen blinked. Looked down the hallway again.<br/>Ms. Thomas was gone. Or at least, around the corner.</p><p class="story-text">He whispered, like the word might break if he said it too loud:<br/>‚Äú‚Ä¶That‚Äôs so inconvenient.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam nodded solemnly. ‚ÄúFor <em>everyone.</em>‚Äù</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="story-text">Lunch at Said-So was a symmetrical affair.</p><p class="story-text">The tables were rectangles. The trays were rectangles. The carrots were aggressively cubed.</p><p class="story-text">Even the conversations had edges‚Äîquiet, polite ones, carefully honed to avoid controversy or crouton-based conflict.</p><p class="story-text">Fen, naturally, did not belong in this environment.</p><p class="story-text">He sat cross-legged on his chair, balancing his tray on one knee like a circus act and spinning a grape tomato with one finger as if waiting for it to confess something.</p><p class="story-text">Sam was mid-sentence‚Äîsomething about a pop quiz and the futility of English class‚Äîwhen Fen stood up abruptly, eyes wide, lips parted.</p><p class="story-text">‚Äú‚Ä¶Oh no,‚Äù Sam said flatly.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúOh <em>yes,</em>‚Äù Fen breathed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúFen. No.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI have never been more sure of anything in my life.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThat cannot possibly be true.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI am a constellation in the shape of a plan, Sam.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a boy with a fruit tray and a delusion.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">But it was too late.<br/>Fen was walking.</p><p class="story-text">No‚Äî<em>striding.</em><br/>He had a sort of spring-loaded confidence that looked like he might either start singing or propose a trade agreement. Either way, he was headed straight for her.</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas was sitting at the far end of the room, hunched slightly over a notebook. Her lunch was untouched. She was scribbling something in a notebook‚Äîprobably grading four separate papers in three different subjects at once, while also editing her own thoughts for clarity.</p><p class="story-text">She didn‚Äôt see him approach.<br/>Which gave him just enough time to second-guess <em>everything.</em></p><p class="story-text">He arrived. Paused. Stared at her hair.</p><p class="story-text">It was up again.</p><p class="story-text">Tidy. Precise. Pencil in bun. And just one hair out of place.</p><p class="story-text">Fen‚Äôs heart sank and soared at the same time.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúHi,‚Äù he said, brightly, like a boy with a parachute full of hope and a small tear at the edge.</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas looked up. Blinked. Smiled.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said, friendly and unfazed. ‚ÄúFen, right?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">He beamed like a lighthouse.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYes. That‚Äôs‚Äîyes. I am he. Me. That is I.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">She tilted her head slightly. ‚ÄúCool. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen realized, all at once, that he had not prepared an actual line.<br/>Or plan.<br/>Or <em>anything</em> beyond walking over here and‚Ä¶<!-- --> <em>existing.</em></p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYour hair,‚Äù he blurted.</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas blinked again.</p><p class="story-text">‚Äú‚Ä¶Okay?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up,‚Äù Fen said.</p><p class="story-text">She touched it reflexively, like she‚Äôd forgotten. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI mean, I liked it down too. Both states. Binary options. Not that you‚Äôre binary. You‚Äôre very‚Ä¶ multi-state.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen made a noise that might‚Äôve been ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù or a mumble.<br/>Then he took a breath. Reset.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to be weird,‚Äù he said, softer. ‚ÄúI just wanted to say I think you‚Äôre kind of incredible. And I was wondering if you ever wanted to‚Äî‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas was already smiling. But it was a different kind now‚Äîgentler.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she said, and it landed like a feather. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really sweet.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen deflated slowly, like a balloon still trying to pretend it had volume.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI‚Äôm flattered,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm not really in that space right now. Mentally. Socially. Or, like, cosmically.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs completely understandable.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúAlso,‚Äù she added, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre, like‚Ä¶ what? Ten?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI‚Äôm very old emotionally,‚Äù Fen said, straight-faced.</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas laughed. Not at him‚Äîjust into the moment.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre very brave,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd that was‚Ä¶ a really lovely almost-compliment about my hair. Thank you.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen bowed slightly, because <em>of course he did.</em></p><p class="story-text">Then he turned around, walked three steps‚Äî</p><p class="story-text">‚Äîand tripped over a chair leg that hadn‚Äôt been there earlier.</p><p class="story-text">Possibly.</p><p class="story-text">Probably.</p><p class="story-text">Maybe.</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="story-text">Fen returned to their table with the solemn dignity of a knight who had charged into battle, lost his horse, his sword, and most of his pride, and was now carefully pretending that had been the plan all along.</p><p class="story-text">He sat. Carefully.</p><p class="story-text">Sam didn‚Äôt say anything at first.</p><p class="story-text">He sipped his juice box. Slowly.<br/>Watched Fen reorient his tray.<br/>Waited a beat.</p><p class="story-text">Then:<br/>‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said, casual as rain, ‚Äúhow‚Äôd your interdimensional coming-of-age go?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen leaned forward, placed a single grape tomato in the center of his napkin like it was a token of wisdom retrieved from a mountain shrine, and whispered:<br/>‚ÄúI think I learned something.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam nodded, resigned.</p><p class="story-text">&quot;Maybe your sister isn&#x27;t into an octogenarian Peter Pan.&quot;</p><p class="story-text">Sam stopped sipping.</p><p class="story-text">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="story-text">Fen waved a hand.</p><p class="story-text">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p><br/><hr/><br/><p class="story-text">The rest of the day passed in a haze of sulking, only some of which was performance art.</p><p class="story-text">Fen slumped through Algebra like a deflated marionette. He drew dramatic Xs over his test answers and labeled them<!-- --> <em>Here Lies My Dignity.</em> In English, he asked if<!-- --> <em>unrequited infatuation</em> was a valid theme for his essay on metaphors and then immediately answered his own question with a sigh that somehow echoed.</p><p class="story-text">At lunch he‚Äôd been poetry. By fourth period, he was a very sad simile.</p><p class="story-text">Sam let him grieve.<br/>Mostly.<br/>There was some poking. Possibly a sandwich crust thrown. Maybe a note passed that read ‚ÄúDear Ms. Thomas, Please ignore my friend‚Äôs entire personality. Sincerely, The Universe.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">But Fen began to recover. Slowly. Quietly.<br/>By the time last bell rang, he‚Äôd remembered that oxygen existed.<br/>And by the time they reached the front steps of the school, he‚Äôd even said a word that wasn‚Äôt a dramatic reenactment of inner despair.</p><p class="story-text">The sky was blue in the way only after-school skies are. Sam had already started talking about going to the corner store for snacks, which Fen translated as <em>healing through sugar,</em> a time-honored tradition.</p><p class="story-text">Fen was just about to agree when he heard it.</p><p class="story-text">Footsteps.</p><p class="story-text">He turned‚Äîhalf instinct, half hope.</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas.</p><p class="story-text">Walking toward them.</p><p class="story-text">Toward <em>him.</em></p><p class="story-text">Hair still up. Pencil still sharp. Eyes unreadable.<br/>And suddenly Fen‚Äôs whole recovery system collapsed into a blinking cursor of panic.</p><p class="story-text">Oh no.<br/>Oh <em>no.</em><br/>She was coming <em>this way.</em><br/>What if she was mad? What if she was <em>kind again</em>? What if she wanted to talk and he had to use <em>words</em> again?</p><p class="story-text">Fen smiled.<br/>Or tried.<br/>It came out looking like someone had described a smile to him once, vaguely, in a cave.</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas stopped in front of them.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúHey, Sam,‚Äù she said, like she wasn‚Äôt about to detonate Fen‚Äôs entire emotional weather system.</p><p class="story-text">Then her eyes flicked to Fen, and the corner of her mouth lifted. Just a small, deliberate smile that said<!-- --> <em>you didn‚Äôt scare me away.</em></p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúMind if I steal your friend for a second?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam, to his credit, did not say a single thing.<br/>He just raised his eyebrows and vanished in the direction of vending machines.</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas nodded toward a bench under a crooked little tree that hadn‚Äôt been trimmed in a while. It felt slightly rebellious. Fen followed.</p><p class="story-text">They sat. The silence was‚Ä¶ oddly okay.</p><p class="story-text">Fen, to his credit, did not immediately self-destruct.<br/>He folded his hands. Waited. Braced.</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas leaned forward, elbows on knees, fingers loosely interlaced.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really sweet, Fen.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen winced.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúNo, hey‚Äîlisten,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the start of a gentle letdown. You already got that. I just‚Äî I wanted to actually<!-- --> <em>talk</em> to you. Because I think you‚Äôre doing something a lot of people don‚Äôt understand how to do.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen blinked. ‚ÄúEmbarrass myself in public?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas snorted. ‚ÄúNo. Well. Yes. But also<!-- --> <em>feel something,</em> say it out loud, and live through the aftermath. That‚Äôs rare. Most people your age don‚Äôt know how to do that yet.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not most people my age,‚Äù Fen mumbled, with a shrug that carried more than even he knew.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI know.‚Äù<br/>She said it like she <em>really</em> knew. Like someone who‚Äôd seen too many people trying too hard to pretend they didn‚Äôt care.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúAnd I think,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúthat maybe you were never told what this part of life is really for. So I want to say it. Just once.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen nodded. Trying not to look at her too directly, in case eye contact made the moment too loud.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to have it all figured out. Like‚Ä¶ relationships right now aren‚Äôt about finding your forever person or whatever. They‚Äôre about <em>figuring out</em> how to be close to someone without losing your mind.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen said nothing. But he was very still.</p><p class="story-text">She nudged his knee gently with hers.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúHaving a crush? That‚Äôs <em>practice.</em> Being &#x27;with&#x27; someone at your age‚Äîif it even happens‚Äîis practice, too. You don‚Äôt have to act like it‚Äôs some huge, serious thing. And you don‚Äôt have to pretend it doesn‚Äôt matter, either. You just‚Ä¶ get to learn how it feels. That‚Äôs enough.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen swallowed. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt stupid?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Ms. Thomas said softly. ‚ÄúIt was <em>human.</em>‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen looked at his hands.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúSam says I‚Äôm weird.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYou <em>are</em> weird,‚Äù she said brightly. ‚ÄúBut in a way that matters.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">And then, after a pause:</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúDo you want the pencil?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Fen looked up.</p><p class="story-text">Ms. Thomas reached into her pocket, pulled out a spare pencil‚Äînot the one in her hair, but a twin. Yellow. Unbitten. Clean.</p><p class="story-text">He stared at it like it might be enchanted.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù he said.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a trophy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a reminder.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúOf what?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThat you can care, try, fail a little, and still be worth someone‚Äôs kindness.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">She handed it over. He took it.</p><p class="story-text">It was just a pencil.<br/>But it wasn‚Äôt.<br/>Not really.</p><p class="story-text">Sam was waiting by the vending machines, holding two suspiciously dented juice boxes and a bag of chips that had clearly been chosen for crunch factor, not flavor. Fen&#x27;s favorite.</p><p class="story-text">He didn&#x27;t say anything when Fen returned. Just held out a juice box and chips like it was a peace offering. Or possibly a bribe.</p><p class="story-text">Fen took it wordlessly. Sat down on the curb next to him.</p><p class="story-text">For a moment, they just sipped.</p><p class="story-text">The wind stirred a little, brushing past them with that after-school kind of hush. The sky was slipping toward gold. Somewhere across the quad, someone was practicing violin poorly and confidently. It was, somehow, perfect.</p><p class="story-text">&quot;So,&quot; Sam said eventually. &quot;Still alive?&quot;</p><p class="story-text">Fen nodded. &quot;Surprisingly intact.&quot;</p><p class="story-text">&quot;She murder your soul gently?&quot;</p><p class="story-text">&quot;No. She gifted it a pencil.&quot;</p><p class="story-text">Sam blinked. &quot;‚Ä¶Is that a metaphor?&quot;</p><p class="story-text">&quot;One hair, Sam. <em>One hair.</em> Out of place in a world of straight lines.&quot; Fen shook his head, grinning. &quot;I think I might be the most ridiculous person alive.&quot;</p><p class="story-text">&quot;Oh, definitely,&quot; Sam said. &quot;But also...&quot;</p><p class="story-text">He bumped his shoulder against Fen&#x27;s.</p><p class="story-text">&quot;Sometimes the most ridiculous things are the most real.&quot;</p><p class="story-text">Fen looked at the pencil again. Then slipped it back into his pocket.</p><p class="story-text">&quot;I think I&#x27;m gonna be really good at love someday,&quot; he said softly. &quot;When I&#x27;m not, you know... completely insane about it.&quot;</p></div><br/><p class="mt-6 mb-2 text-center text-muted-foreground">I&#x27;d love to hear what moments mattered most to you.</p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQARjat_oEJ9cNEb1fzWJaNyRRP6n44WkeydZRub3VvCmXoA/viewform?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=112014812140367339055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-lg bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground font-medium hover:opacity-90 transition mb-4">üí≠ Share What Stayed With You</a><br/><br/><a href="https://elsebeneath.online" class="inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-lg bg-primary text-primary-foreground font-medium hover:opacity-90 transition">üîô Return Home</a><div class="row py-2 lg:py-0 items-center flex-wrap-reverse"><div class="text-center lg:col-6 lg:mb-0 lg:text-left"><ul><li class="m-2 inline-block">¬© Juno Threadborne 2025<!-- --> <a href="https://thrd.me/mirror">‚ú®</a></li></ul></div></div></div><!--astro:end--></astro-island> </main>  <div class="fixed top-6 left-6 flex flex-col items-end z-50" data-astro-cid-oaqs7v6q> <!-- Floating Action Button --> <button id="share-fab" class="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white w-12 h-12 rounded-full shadow-lg flex items-center justify-center transition-transform duration-300" data-astro-cid-oaqs7v6q> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentColor" class="w-6 h-6" data-astro-cid-oaqs7v6q> <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M4 12v7a1 1 0 001 1h14a1 1 0 001-1v-7M16 6l-4-4m0 0L8 6m4-4v14" data-astro-cid-oaqs7v6q></path> </svg> </button> <!-- Social Buttons (hidden until hover) --> <div class="relative flex flex-col items-end" data-astro-cid-oaqs7v6q> <!-- Social Buttons --> <div id="share-buttons" class="flex flex-col gap-2 opacity-0 translate-y-2 pointer-events-none mt-2 transition-all duration-300" data-astro-cid-oaqs7v6q> <a href="https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Check%20out%20this%20story%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fjunothreadborne.me/story/hair" target="_blank" class="bg-white hover:bg-blue-200 w-10 h-10 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center" data-astro-cid-oaqs7v6q> <img src="/bsky.png" alt="Bluesky" class="w-5 h-5" data-astro-cid-oaqs7v6q> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20this%20story%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fjunothreadborne.me/story/hair" target="_blank" class="bg-black hover:bg-gray-800 w-10 h-10 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-white" data-astro-cid-oaqs7v6q> <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" class="w-5 h-5" data-astro-cid-oaqs7v6q> <path d="M23 3a10.9 10.9 0 0 1-3.14 1.53 4.48 4.48 0 0 0-7.86 3v1A10.66
