class="story-text">Sam hadn‚Äôt meant to stay long.</p><p class="story-text">He‚Äôd only come to the Village of Voicekeepers for a ribbon. A simple one. Sky-colored, if he could find it. The kind that didn‚Äôt whisper too much when the wind passed by.</p><p class="story-text">The scarf-seller‚Äôs stall had dozens, of course.<br/>Too many.</p><p class="story-text">One of them laughed as he reached toward it. The seller didn‚Äôt seem to notice. She was too busy rearranging her display, murmuring to the ribbons like a florist calming a restless bouquet.</p><p class="story-text">Sam ran his fingers through the tangles of fabric. Some of them had messages written in pen, others plain, others with designs that changed with their mood.</p><p class="story-text">He chose a simple cornflower blue ribbon. It had the words, &quot;because your voice matters to me&quot; in shiny gold lettering on one side.<br/>He held it in his hand for just a moment‚Äîjust in case something<!-- --> <em>Elsebeneath</em> happened.</p><p class="story-text">But it stayed quiet. Ribbons only whispered if you were unsure what they were meant to carry.</p><p class="story-text">He pulled the ribbon from the tangle.</p><p class="story-text">&quot;Perfect,&quot; he thought out loud. He left a handful of buttons on the counter and bounded out the door.</p><p class="story-text">Up the street, a weathervane was arguing with a chimney about whose turn it was to point at the clouds.</p><p class="story-text">It was one of those mornings.</p><p class="story-text">He wandered past the fountain.<br/>Past the chime that always rang when someone was almost about to say something important.<br/>Past the bakery with the jam that tasted like secrets you hadn‚Äôt told yet.<br/>And into the square where the wind liked to rehearse.</p><p class="story-text">He paused.</p><p class="story-text">Not for long. Just enough to notice that the breeze was tugging left today‚Äîtoward the overlook.</p><p class="story-text">Sam almost said something.<br/>He didn‚Äôt know what.</p><p class="story-text">He thought about the ribbon in his pocket.</p><p class="story-text">He hadn‚Äôt picked it for anyone in particular. But maybe he had.<br/>Maybe himself.</p><p class="story-text">He wasn‚Äôt great with saying things. Not when they <em>mattered.</em><br/>He liked to get it right. To understand first. To wait for the shape of a moment before filling it.</p><p class="story-text">Which meant sometimes‚Ä¶<br/>He missed his chance entirely.</p><hr/><p class="story-text">As he reached the edge of the village, he caught something in the corner of his eye.</p><p class="story-text">An amphitheater.</p><p class="story-text">Stone walls curved like cupped hands.<br/>A staircase flowed downward, inviting and dramatic.<br/>And just as Sam blinked‚Äî</p><p class="story-text">The whole fa√ßade blushed.</p><p class="story-text">A warm coral hue bloomed across the stone, rippling like a skipped heartbeat. Somewhere above, a spotlight flickered into existence and aimed itself <em>not</em> at the stage‚Äîbut at Sam.</p><p class="story-text">He blinked again.</p><p class="story-text">Then a voice called up from below.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúOh! Um. Hi! Don‚Äôt mind her. She just gets like that sometimes.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam squinted.</p><p class="story-text">A young gecko in a vest three buttons too confident for its wearer waved both hands‚Äîthen thought better of it and tried to look casual, which made everything worse.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said, tail twitching. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been dormant all week. You show up with an armful of honest emotion and she lights up like a sunrise. Typical.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">He trotted up a few steps, offered a nervous smile, and stuck out a webbed hand.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI‚Äôm Glin. I run the place.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam shook it.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThe wall just‚Ä¶ blushed at me.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Glin winced. ‚ÄúYeah. She does that. You didn‚Äôt say anything dramatic, did you?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Glin said. ‚ÄúJust‚Äîtry not to monologue. Not until you‚Äôve had a proper introduction. The stage is a bit of a sucker for big entrances.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">He gestured down the staircase.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúCome on. I‚Äôll show you around.‚Äù</p><h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: <em>Staged</em></h1><p class="story-text">Glin talked like someone trying not to notice a fire in the other room.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThis is the cue well,‚Äù he said, gesturing to what looked like a wishing fountain full of torn script pages. ‚ÄúTechnically she calls it the <em>Well of Implied Meaning,</em> but‚Äîwell. It mostly just coughs up scene changes when people get vague.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">A wet splat sounded behind them. Another page surfaced, smoking slightly at the corners. Glin ignored it.</p><p class="story-text">Sam followed him down a narrow corridor lined with mismatched curtains. One of them blinked.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúShe responds best to clarity,‚Äù Glin went on. ‚ÄúStrong choices. Honest feelings. Theatricality is fine‚Äîencouraged, really‚Äîbut if you try to fake your way through a scene, she‚Äôll chew it and spit it out.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúChew it?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Glin nodded. ‚ÄúOne time she turned a monologue into actual bees.<!-- --> <em>Thousands.</em>‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam&#x27;s mouth opened to speak, but behind them, someone shouted something muffled and sharp. Another voice hissed in reply. Sam glanced over his shoulder. Glin quickened his pace.</p><p class="story-text">They passed a stack of props labeled<!-- --> <strong>NOT CURRENTLY RELEVANT</strong> and a full costume rack that shuffled slightly when Sam leaned in too closely.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThis is wardrobe,‚Äù Glin said, stopping for breath. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch anything unless you want your outfit to match your subconscious.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">He pulled a curtain aside and waved Sam through.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúAnd here,‚Äù he said, as they stepped into the main space, ‚Äúis the Stage.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">It was bigger than Sam expected.</p><p class="story-text">Circular, tiered, and half-draped in clouds. The seats looked like they‚Äôd been carved from old applause‚Äîshaped by clapping hands and smoothed by time.</p><p class="story-text">The Stage itself was empty.</p><p class="story-text">And not.</p><p class="story-text">The top tier of the stage was ringed by a thick crimson curtain.<br/>Somewhere above, lighting rigs moved without wires.<br/>A breeze passed that tasted like the end of an argument.<br/>And faintly, just under the surface of everything, the floor<!-- --> <em>throbbed</em>‚Äîlike a drum that hadn‚Äôt picked a rhythm yet.</p><p class="story-text">From somewhere behind the curtain, Sam heard a voice. Low. Gravely.</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">‚ÄúLast week, I could‚Äôve sworn it ended with a door closing. But yesterday I watched it close <em>before</em> anyone left.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">&quot;Who&#x27;s that?&quot; Sam asked.</p><p class="story-text">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry about them,&quot; Glin said, a bit too brightly. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I finish showing you around?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">He turned before Sam could respond and started toward the far end of the stage, gesturing to a staircase carved into the stonework. It wasn‚Äôt clear if it led up or down‚Äîonly that it moved somewhere<!-- --> <em>else</em>.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúIs it always like this?‚Äù Sam asked, keeping pace.</p><p class="story-text">Glin didn‚Äôt look back.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThe Stage. The lights. The‚Ä¶‚Äù He gestured vaguely. ‚ÄúMood.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Glin said. ‚ÄúRight. No, she‚Äôs just in one of her loops again.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúLoops?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Glin nodded. ‚ÄúShe gets like this when a scene won‚Äôt settle. Doesn‚Äôt know which version to hold onto, so she keeps trying them on‚Äîlike costume changes.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam heard another voice. This one lighter.</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">‚ÄúIt was a goodbye, or a warning. I honestly don‚Äôt know anymore.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">Glin kept walking. They passed a spiral staircase that dissolved as they reached the bottom step, and a doorway labeled<!-- --> <strong>NO ENTRY DURING REWRITE.</strong></p><p class="story-text">He pointed as they passed:</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Emotion Pit. Don‚Äôt fall in‚Äîit‚Äôs mostly unresolved tension and fog right now. Over here‚Äôs the Inflection Balcony. Great acoustics, terrible for subtext.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúAnd that,‚Äù Glin said, pointing to a stone arch shaped like an ellipsis, ‚Äúis the Hall of Unspeakable Lines. Don‚Äôt ask.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Another shout rang out behind them. Closer now. Followed by a voice that dropped like a guillotine.</p><blockquote class="story-callout"><p class="story-text">&quot;Do <em>not</em> bring me into this.&quot;</p></blockquote><p class="story-text">Sam stopped.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúWhat are they arguing about?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Glin stopped too.</p><p class="story-text">His shoulders slumped. Just for a second.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúSomething about the final scene,‚Äù he said at last. ‚ÄúIt changed. Or they did. Or both.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam tilted his head.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúChanged how?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Glin hesitated. Then sighed.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThe door. I think it should‚Äôve been a gate.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam frowned. ‚ÄúBut you run the place.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Glin said. ‚ÄúBut the Amphibio‚Äôth√©atre doesn‚Äôt answer to me.‚Äù</p><hr/><p class="story-text">They turned back toward the stage.</p><p class="story-text">A loud <em>thud</em>, and the curtain rose. In its place stood three actors.</p><p class="story-text">The first‚Äîa woman in a cape‚Äîpaced in tight circles, her boots striking harder than necessary.<br/>The tall one leaned against a curtain rod that hadn‚Äôt been there before, arms crossed, one eyebrow raised like a challenge he hadn‚Äôt bothered to voice.<br/>And the youngest‚Äî</p><p class="story-text">He hovered.</p><p class="story-text">You could feel it. Their steps were hesitant, each one angled slightly toward someone else. They looked like they were trying to agree with all three of them at once.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúShould we leave?‚Äù Sam asked.</p><p class="story-text">Glin grimaced.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in it now.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">They stepped forward as the woman turned sharply.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI am <em>not</em> going through it again,‚Äù she said. Her cape flared like a wall of candles. ‚ÄúWe made the choice. We<!-- --> <em>rehearsed</em> the choice. And then he‚Äî‚Äù She pointed at the tall one without looking at him. ‚Äú‚Äîdecided it was the <em>wrong kind</em> <!-- -->of tragedy.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">The tall one unfolded his fan with a snap. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said calmly, ‚ÄúI decided it was lazy. You can‚Äôt substitute silence for resolution and call it art.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what it was,‚Äù said the youngest, but no one looked at him.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúGlin,‚Äù the woman said, still staring at the fan. ‚ÄúTell me you‚Äôre not dragging in civilians.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dragging,‚Äù Glin muttered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm... inviting.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">She scoffed and folded her arms.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúWonderful. An invited audience.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam shifted his weight.</p><p class="story-text">He was used to stories. Used to feeling them move.</p><p class="story-text">But this wasn‚Äôt movement. It was <em>static</em>.</p><p class="story-text">And it hummed.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYou think I <em>meant</em> to forget?‚Äù the youngest blurted. They had turned to the woman now‚Äîsmall, unsure, unraveling.</p><p class="story-text">She didn‚Äôt answer.</p><p class="story-text">Sam looked to Glin. Glin raised his hands helplessly.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYou said the scene changed,‚Äù Sam said. ‚ÄúWhat was it before?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Three heads turned toward him.</p><p class="story-text">Three different silences followed.</p><h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: <em>Her Lines</em></h1><p class="story-text">It was the cape that moved first.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said.</p><p class="story-text">Then louder:</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll just show you.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">She reached up, unfastened the clasp at her shoulder, and flung her cape high into the air.</p><p class="story-text">It caught the stage light mid-spin, swallowed it whole, and drifted down slow‚Äîlike a curtain falling before the scene even started.</p><p class="story-text">Darkness pooled in its wake.</p><p class="story-text">Then: a single spotlight.</p><p class="story-text">Cal stepped into it like she‚Äôd been born for it.</p><p class="story-text">And then she began.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThe room was quiet.‚Äù Her voice echoed, just slightly.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúNot because there was nothing to say. But because sometimes‚Ä¶<br/>silence says exactly what it needs to.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">The stage obeyed. It painted the walls in melancholy dusk.<br/>The furniture rearranged itself around her like a loyal ensemble.<br/>A chair, a map, a door.</p><p class="story-text">She stood center.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúHe was already halfway gone,‚Äù she said, not looking toward Jun. &quot;And I knew better than to chase someone who had decided to leave.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">She walked slowly, one hand brushing the edge of a table that hadn‚Äôt been there a moment ago.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI could‚Äôve said something.

No missed glances. The door behind Jun hung open like a polite afterthought.</p><p class="story-text">Even Arin‚Äîseated to the side, hands folded‚Äîlooked more like a prop than a person. No fidgeting. No storm behind the eyes. Just quiet admiration. Like a student watching a master class.</p><p class="story-text">Jun stood up.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how it happened.&quot;</p><p class="story-text">Cal froze.</p><p class="story-text">The lights rose.</p><p class="story-text">And Jun stepped up.</p><h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4: <em>His Lines</em></h1><p class="story-text">Jun didn‚Äôt move for a long time.</p><p class="story-text">The stage still wore Cal‚Äôs silence like a shawl.</p><p class="story-text">But then ‚Äî slowly ‚Äî he stepped forward.</p><p class="story-text">No flourish.

No spotlight. Like the theater was listening, but not performing.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a door,‚Äù Jun said.</p><p class="story-text">His voice was low. Not quiet, exactly ‚Äî just the kind of voice you leaned toward without knowing why.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what she remembers. Because that‚Äôs what she gave me. A door. An exit. A clean goodbye.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">He gestured towards the back of the stage.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúBut I saw a hallway.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">He walked slowly across the stage, and with each step, the set changed.</p><p class="story-text">Walls stretched.

But said nothing.</p><p class="story-text">Jun stared at the echo.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI thought‚Ä¶ if someone said my name, I‚Äôd stop.<br/>If someone reached for me, I‚Äôd turn around.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">The echo didn‚Äôt move.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúNo one did.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Jun stood again.</p><p class="story-text">The hallway crumbled behind him.</p><p class="story-text">He looked at Cal. Not with blame.</p><p class="story-text">And then at Arin.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking to be forgiven,‚Äù he said.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúI just wanted you to know‚Ä¶<br/>I didn‚Äôt leave because I didn‚Äôt care.<br/>I left because I didn‚Äôt believe I was allowed to stay.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Cal looked away.</p><p class="story-text">Jun just stood there, hands in his pockets, like he was waiting for a train that might never come.</p><p class="story-text">Sam took a slow step back from the stage.</p><p class="story-text">Glin was at the steps, arms crossed, chewing the inside of his cheek like it owed him rent.</p><p class="story-text">Sam joined him quietly.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Sam said, ‚Äúhe left.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Glin nodded.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúAnd she let him.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam squinted toward Arin.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúSo what about them?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Glin followed his gaze.</p><p class="story-text">Then: a sigh.

Just tired.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúArin wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in the scene.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Glin tilted his head.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThat part was smaller, originally. Three lines. A stage direction.<br/>They weren‚Äôt even cast until the second rewrite.‚Äù</p><p class="story-text">Sam looked again.</p><p class="story-text">Arin was still watching the page.</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúThen why are they still here?‚Äù he asked.</p><p class="story-text">Glin didn‚Äôt answer right away.</p><p class="story-text">Then:</p><p class="story-text">‚ÄúBecause they remember all the versions.‚Äù</p><h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5: <em>Their Lines</em></h1><p class="story-text">Arin stepped forward.</p><p class="story-text">Slowly.</p><p class="story-text">No light followed.</p><p class="story-text">They didn‚Äôt ask for one.</p><p class="story-text">But after a moment‚Äîwhen they reached the center of the stage‚Äî<br/>a soft white glow found them anyway.<br/>Like the Stage had been waiting for them to finally speak.</p><p class="story-text">Only they didn‚Äôt.</p><p class="story-text">Not yet.</p><p class="story-text">They took their place in the same scene.<br/>The one Cal had conjured.
